Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'hopping (one foot jumping)' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs a 'hopping (one foot jumping)' action by bending the knee of the supporting leg, propelling upward with a forceful extension of the ankle, knee, and hip, while the other leg remains flexed and lifted, followed by a controlled landing on the same foot.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'hopping (one foot jumping)': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright with gaze forward for balance.  
Hand: May swing slightly or stay relaxed at the sides.  
Arm: Swings opposite the hopping leg to aid momentum.  
Hip: Flexes slightly to generate upward force.  
Leg: The hopping leg bends then extends powerfully.  
Foot: Pushes off the ground and lands on the ball then heel.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'hopping (one foot jumping)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Slightly flexes and extends to generate upward force.  
2-middle of the spine: Stabilizes torso during takeoff and landing.  
3-neck: Remains steady to support head balance.  
4-head: Stays upright with gaze forward for stability.  
13-left hip: Flexes and extends to drive hopping leg motion.  
14-left knee: Bends deeply before explosive extension.  
15-left ankle: Plantarflexes to push off and dorsiflexes to land.  
17-right hip: Lifts slightly to keep non-hopping leg raised.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'hopping (one foot jumping)' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features recognizing 'hopping (one foot jumping)' include a forceful extension of the ankle, knee, and hip of the hopping leg, slight lift of the non-hopping leg, upright head and torso for balance, and coordinated arm swings for momentum.
