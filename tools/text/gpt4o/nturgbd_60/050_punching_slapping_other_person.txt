Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'punching/slapping other person' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body initiates the punching/slapping action by contracting the arm and shoulder muscles to rapidly extend the forearm and hand toward the target, generating force through kinetic chain movement from the legs, hips, and torso, while maintaining balance through slight adjustments in stance and core engagement.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'punching/slapping other person': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward with eyes focused on the target.  
Hand: Tightly clenched (punch) or open with fingers extended (slap).  
Arm: Rapidly extends forward with force from the shoulder.  
Hip: Rotates slightly to add power to the motion.  
Leg: Front leg stabilizes while back leg may push off slightly.  
Foot: Front foot stays planted while back foot may pivot for balance.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'punching/slapping other person' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly leans forward to align with the striking motion.  
4-head: Faces the target with focused gaze.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates forward to initiate punching motion.  
6-left elbow: Extends rapidly for a punch or remains flexible for a slap.  
7-left wrist: Stabilizes for punch or bends slightly for slap impact.  
9-right shoulder: Rotates forward to generate power for the strike.  
10-right elbow: Extends sharply for punch or adjusts angle for slap.  
11-right wrist: Stiffens for punch or remains loose for slap follow-through.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'punching/slapping other person' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by forward head and neck alignment, rapid shoulder rotation, elbow extension, wrist stabilization for punches or flexibility for slaps, and coordinated hip and leg movement for balance and power generation.
