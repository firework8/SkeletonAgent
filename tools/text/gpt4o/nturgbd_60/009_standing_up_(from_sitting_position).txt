Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'standing up (from sitting position)' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'standing up from a sitting position' action by shifting the torso forward, engaging the leg and core muscles to lift the hips off the seat, extending the knees and hips to straighten the legs, and finally stabilizing the posture to achieve an upright stance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'standing up (from sitting position)': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly leans forward to initiate balance.  
Hand: May press on armrests or thighs for support.  
Arm: Engages to push off surfaces if needed.  
Hip: Hinges forward to shift weight over feet.  
Leg: Extends at the knee to lift the body upward.  
Foot: Presses into the ground to provide stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'standing up (from sitting position)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Shifts forward to initiate standing motion.  
2-middle of the spine: Extends upward as torso straightens.  
13-left hip: Hinges forward to transfer weight over legs.  
14-left knee: Extends to lift the body upward.  
17-right hip: Hinges forward to assist weight transfer.  
18-right knee: Extends to push body into standing.  
21-spine: Aligns vertically as posture stabilizes.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'standing up (from sitting position)' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features recognizing standing up from sitting include forward hip hinge, knee extension for upward lift, spine straightening for posture alignment, and coordinated weight transfer from seated to upright position.
