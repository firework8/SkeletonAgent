Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'falling' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performing the 'falling' action moves downward due to gravity, typically losing balance or support, with limbs often flailing instinctively to regain stability or brace for impact.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'falling': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Jerks backward or forward to counterbalance the fall.  
Hand: Flails outward or reaches to break the fall.  
Arm: Extends or bends instinctively to protect the body.  
Hip: Twists or drops abruptly as balance is lost.  
Leg: Stiffens or collapses depending on impact.  
Foot: Lifts or drags as the body loses footing.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'falling' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Shifts abruptly downward as balance is lost.  
2-middle of the spine: Bends or twists to compensate for the fall.  
3-neck: Jerks forward or backward to stabilize the head.  
4-head: Tilts sharply to counterbalance the falling motion.  
5-left shoulder: Raises or drops suddenly to protect the body.  
6-left elbow: Flexes or extends to brace for impact.  
7-left wrist: Bends to absorb shock or reach for support.  
13-left hip: Drops or rotates as the leg collapses.  
14-left knee: Buckles or stiffens depending on fall direction.  
17-right hip: Twists or drops asymmetrically to the left.  
18-right knee: Bends abruptly to reduce impact force.  
21-spine: Arches or twists to redistribute momentum.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'falling' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'falling' action is characterized by sudden downward shifts in the spine, abrupt limb movements to brace or flail, sharp head tilts for balance, and asymmetrical hip/knee collapses as the body loses stability.
