Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cough' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The 'cough' action begins with a deep inhalation, followed by a rapid closure of the glottis and contraction of the abdominal and thoracic muscles to build pressure, then the glottis suddenly opens, forcing air and mucus out through the mouth.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cough': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: May tilt slightly forward or jerk with the force of the cough.  
Hand: Often remains relaxed or may briefly tense near the chest or mouth.  
Arm: Typically stays still or moves slightly inward toward the body.  
Hip: Generally remains stable with minimal movement.  
Leg: Usually stays stationary, maintaining balance.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground without shifting.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'cough' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: May jerk forward slightly with the force of the cough.  
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly as chest muscles contract.  
5-left shoulder: Lifts slightly in sync with the right shoulder.  
8-right hip: Stabilizes posture with minimal movement.  
11-left hip: Remains steady to maintain balance.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'cough' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'cough' action is recognized by a slight forward jerk of the head, a brief lift of both shoulders, and minimal stabilizing movement in the hips while the rest of the body remains relatively still.
