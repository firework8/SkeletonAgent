Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cut the tree' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body begins by gripping an axe with both hands, then raises it overhead while slightly bending the knees, and forcefully swings it downward in an arc to strike the tree trunk, followed by resetting the stance for the next swing.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cut the tree': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Looks forward at the tree to focus on the target.  
Hand: Grips the axe handle firmly with both hands.  
Arm: Swings the axe upward and then forcefully downward.  
Hip: Rotates slightly to generate power for the swing.  
Leg: Bends at the knees to stabilize and balance the body.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground to maintain a steady stance.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'cut the tree' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates backward during axe lift, forward during swing.  
3-right elbow: Bends to raise axe, extends forcefully downward.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes and supports right shoulder movement.  
6-left elbow: Maintains a firm grip, slightly bends for control.  
8-right hip: Twists slightly to generate power for the swing.  
11-left hip: Anchors the body, balancing right hip rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'cut the tree' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder and hip rotation driving forceful elbow extension in a downward axe swing while maintaining stable lower-body support.
