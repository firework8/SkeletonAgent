Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'use a lever to lift something' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body positions the lever under an object, applies downward force on one end to create a pivot point, and lifts the opposite end, raising the object with mechanical advantage.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'use a lever to lift something': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Looks at the lever and object to align positioning.  
Hand: Grips the lever firmly to apply downward force.  
Arm: Extends or bends to push or pull the lever.  
Hip: Stabilizes the torso to maintain balance during lifting.  
Leg: Adjusts stance to brace against the ground for leverage.  
Foot: Anchors firmly to the ground to counter the lifting force.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'use a lever to lift something' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates to position the arm for lever control.  
3-right elbow: Flexes to apply downward force on the lever.  
4-right wrist: Stabilizes grip while pushing or pulling.  
5-left shoulder: Adjusts posture to balance body tension.  
6-left elbow: May bend to assist in counterbalancing.  
8-right hip: Anchors torso for stability during lifting.  
11-left hip: Shifts weight to support leverage motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'use a lever to lift something' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder and elbow flexion to apply force on the lever, wrist stabilization for grip, hip anchoring for balance, and weight shifts to generate lifting motion.
