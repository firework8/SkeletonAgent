Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'follow me' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'follow me' action by extending an arm outward with the palm facing up, then curling the fingers inward repeatedly while maintaining eye contact to signal someone to approach or follow.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'follow me': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to look at the person being signaled.  
Hand: Palm faces upward with fingers curling inward repeatedly.  
Arm: Extends outward from the body at a relaxed angle.  
Hip: Shifts weight slightly toward the side of the extended arm.  
Leg: Remains stable with knees slightly bent for balance.  
Foot: Stays planted or takes a small step forward if moving.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'follow me' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates slightly forward as the arm extends.  
3-right elbow: Bends to position the hand for the curling motion.  
4-right wrist: Holds steady while fingers curl inward repeatedly.  
5-left shoulder: Remains relaxed or slightly pulled back for balance.  
6-left elbow: Stays bent at the side for natural posture.  
7-left wrist: Minimal movement, may mirror right hand subtly.  
8-right hip: Shifts weight slightly forward when stepping.  
11-left hip: Adjusts stance to support the extended arm.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'follow me' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'follow me' action is recognized by an extended arm with a curling hand gesture, slight forward shoulder rotation, balanced hip adjustments, and stable yet responsive posture.
