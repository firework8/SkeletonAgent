Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'walk' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body moves forward by alternately lifting and swinging each leg while shifting weight from the rear foot to the front foot, maintaining balance through coordinated arm movements and subtle adjustments in posture.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'walk': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright with slight forward tilt and subtle side-to-side motion. Hand: Relaxed with slight natural swing matching opposite leg. Arm: Swings forward and backward in opposition to legs. Hip: Rotates slightly forward with each step to extend leg reach. Leg: Alternates between stance (supporting weight) and swing (moving forward). Foot: Heel strikes first, then rolls to toe for push-off.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'walk' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates forward and backward in sync with arm swing.  
3-right elbow: Bends slightly during arm swing, extending on backward motion.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates opposite to right shoulder, aiding balance.  
6-left elbow: Flexes and extends in coordination with left arm swing.  
8-right hip: Drives right leg forward with controlled rotation.  
11-left hip: Moves opposite to right hip, stabilizing gait.  
9-right knee: Bends during swing phase, straightens at heel strike.  
12-left knee: Alternates flexion and extension with each step.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'walk' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'walk' action is recognized by alternating arm swings synchronized with opposing leg movements, hip rotation driving each step, and coordinated knee flexion-extension during heel strikes and push-offs.
