Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'drop something' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand opens, releasing the object, which then falls downward due to gravity while the arm may remain stationary or slightly retract.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'drop something': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: May tilt slightly downward to watch the falling object.  
Hand: Opens abruptly, releasing the object.  
Arm: May stay still or slightly retract after release.  
Hip: Remains stable with minimal movement.  
Leg: Stays grounded, maintaining balance.  
Foot: Keeps flat or adjusts slightly for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'drop something' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
4, 7

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
4-right wrist: Opens abruptly, releasing the held object.  
7-left wrist: Opens abruptly, releasing the held object.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'drop something' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features for recognizing the 'drop something' action are the abrupt opening of the wrists to release an object while the rest of the body remains largely stable.
