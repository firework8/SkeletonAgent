Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'not clear' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'not clear' action by shrugging the shoulders, tilting the head slightly, and raising the palms upward with a confused expression.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'not clear': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly to one side with a puzzled expression.  
Hand: Palms turn upward or outward in a questioning gesture.  
Arm: Lifts slightly with elbows bent in uncertainty.  
Hip: Shifts weight to one side in a relaxed stance.  
Leg: Remains still or adjusts stance slightly for balance.  
Foot: Stays planted or shifts position subtly.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'not clear' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Slightly tilts forward or to the side in confusion.  
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly in a shrug.  
5-left shoulder: Lifts slightly in a shrug.  
14-right eye: Squints or widens slightly with uncertainty.  
15-left eye: Squints or widens slightly with uncertainty.  
16-right ear: May tilt subtly with head movement.  
17-left ear: May tilt subtly with head movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'not clear' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'not clear' action is recognized by a slight head tilt, raised shoulders in a shrug, upward or outward palms, and subtle eye or ear movements conveying uncertainty.
