Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'stalk someone' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body moves cautiously with slow, deliberate steps, maintaining a low profile by staying close to walls or shadows, while the head turns subtly to track the target and the eyes remain focused ahead or peripherally scanning the surroundings.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'stalk someone': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns subtly to track the target while avoiding direct eye contact.  
Hand: Stays relaxed but ready, sometimes lightly touching surfaces for balance.  
Arm: Remains close to the body, minimizing swinging movements.  
Hip: Shifts slightly to adjust weight during quiet steps.  
Leg: Moves slowly with controlled, deliberate strides.  
Foot: Steps lightly, placing the outer edge or toe first to muffle sound.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'stalk someone' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Turns subtly to track the target while avoiding direct gaze.  
2-right shoulder: Stays slightly lowered to minimize movement.  
5-left shoulder: Mirrors the right, keeping tension controlled.  
8-right hip: Shifts weight smoothly for quiet steps.  
11-left hip: Balances movement with the right for stealth.  
9-right knee: Bends slightly for controlled strides.  
12-left knee: Coordinates with the right for fluid motion.  
10-right ankle: Rolls softly to muffle footfalls.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'stalk someone' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by subtle head tracking, lowered shoulders, controlled hip shifts, bent knees, and soft ankle movements for quiet, deliberate steps.
