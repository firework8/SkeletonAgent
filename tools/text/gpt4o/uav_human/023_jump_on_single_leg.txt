Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'jump on single leg' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'jump on single leg' action by bending the knee of the standing leg, swinging the arms upward for momentum, and explosively extending the knee to propel the body vertically while the other leg remains lifted or bent.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'jump on single leg': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright with eyes focused forward or slightly upward.  
Hand: Fingers may spread slightly for balance or remain relaxed.  
Arm: Swings upward for momentum or stays bent at the elbow for stability.  
Hip: Flexes slightly as the standing leg bends before extending explosively.  
Leg: The standing leg bends then extends forcefully to propel the body upward.  
Foot: The standing foot pushes off the ground while the other foot stays lifted.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'jump on single leg' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Remains stable, facing forward or slightly upward.  
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly as right arm swings for momentum.  
5-left shoulder: Lifts slightly as left arm swings for balance.  
9-right knee: Bends deeply then extends explosively to propel jump.  
10-right ankle: Flexes then pushes off the ground forcefully.  
11-left hip: Stabilizes as left leg remains lifted or bent.  
12-left knee: Stays bent or slightly raised during jump.  
13-left ankle: Remains flexed or lifted off the ground.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'jump on single leg' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'jump on single leg' action is recognized by the explosive extension of the standing leg's knee and ankle, upward arm swing for momentum, slight shoulder lift, and the non-standing leg remaining bent or lifted while the head stays stable.
