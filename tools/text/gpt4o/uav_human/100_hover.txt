Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'hover' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'hover' action by slightly bending the knees, engaging the core for stability, and maintaining a balanced, upright posture while minimizing visible movement to create the illusion of floating.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'hover': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly lifted with a neutral gaze forward.  
Hand: Relaxed or slightly curved with minimal movement.  
Arm: Hanging loosely or bent slightly at the elbows.  
Hip: Balanced and stable with subtle weight shifts.  
Leg: Knees softly bent to absorb slight motion.  
Foot: Lightly grounded with even pressure distribution.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'hover' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Slightly lifted with a stable, forward-facing position.  
2-right shoulder: Relaxed with minimal upward or downward movement.  
5-left shoulder: Balanced symmetrically with the right shoulder.  
8-right hip: Subtle weight shifts to maintain hovering balance.  
9-right knee: Softly bent to absorb slight motion.  
11-left hip: Mirrors right hip for even weight distribution.  
12-left knee: Gently flexed in sync with the right knee.  
13-left ankle: Lightly grounded with controlled flexibility.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'hover' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'hover' action is recognized by a stable upright posture with slightly bent knees, balanced hip shifts, relaxed shoulders, and minimal movement in the limbs while maintaining a forward-facing head.
