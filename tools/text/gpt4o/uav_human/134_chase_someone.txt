Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'chase someone' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body leans forward, pumps arms vigorously, and rapidly alternates legs in a sprinting motion while maintaining balance and focus on the target.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'chase someone': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns to track the target while maintaining forward focus.  
Hand: Fingers slightly curled, palms relaxed but ready to react.  
Arm: Swings powerfully in sync with opposite leg for momentum.  
Hip: Rotates slightly with each stride to maximize speed.  
Leg: Drives forcefully against the ground to propel forward.  
Foot: Lands on the ball then pushes off for rapid steps.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'chase someone' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates forward and back with arm swing.  
3-right elbow: Bends and extends rapidly during running motion.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates opposite to right shoulder for balance.  
6-left elbow: Mirrors right elbow’s bend and extension.  
8-right hip: Drives leg backward for propulsion.  
9-right knee: Flexes and extends to push off ground.  
11-left hip: Coordinates with right hip for stride rhythm.  
12-left knee: Works with right knee for alternating steps.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'chase someone' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by alternating arm swings with shoulder rotation, rapid elbow flexion, driving hip movements, and forceful knee extensions to propel forward in pursuit.
