Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'salute' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'salute' action by raising the right hand sharply, fingers extended and joined, with the palm facing downward, and bringing the tip of the right forefinger to the edge of the forehead or the brim of the headgear, then lowering the hand back to the side in a smooth motion.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'salute': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Faces forward with a neutral or attentive expression.  
Hand: Right hand fingers extended and joined, palm angled slightly down.  
Arm: Right arm raises sharply, elbow slightly forward, then lowers smoothly.  
Hip: Remains stable and aligned with the torso.  
Leg: Both legs straight and slightly tensed, weight evenly distributed.  
Foot: Feet together or slightly apart, heels aligned, toes pointed forward.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'salute' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly as the arm raises.  
3-right elbow: Bends slightly, then straightens during the salute.  
4-right wrist: Remains straight with fingers extended.  
5-left shoulder: Stays stable to maintain posture.  
6-left elbow: Remains straight, arm at the side.  
7-left wrist: Stays neutral, hand relaxed.  
14-right eye: Focuses forward with attention.  
15-left eye: Focuses forward with attention.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'salute' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'salute' action is recognized by the right arm sharply raising with a straight wrist and extended fingers touching the forehead while the left arm remains steady at the side, the shoulders and elbows adjust to the motion, and the eyes focus forward with an upright posture.
