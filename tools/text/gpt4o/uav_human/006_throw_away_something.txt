Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'throw away something' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body initiates the 'throw away something' action by gripping the object, lifting the arm backward, then swiftly propelling it forward with a release at the peak of motion, using coordinated shoulder, elbow, and wrist movements to direct the throw.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'throw away something': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to focus on the target.  
Hand: Grips the object before releasing it mid-throw.  
Arm: Swings backward then forward to generate throwing force.  
Hip: Rotates slightly to add power to the throw.  
Leg: Shifts weight from back to front for balance.  
Foot: Steps forward or pivots to stabilize the motion.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'throw away something' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates backward then forward to initiate throw.  
3-right elbow: Bends then extends to propel the object.  
4-right wrist: Flicks forward to release the object.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes and balances the upper body.  
6-left elbow: Slightly bends to maintain posture.  
7-left wrist: Remains steady for counterbalance.  
8-right hip: Twists to generate throwing power.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'throw away something' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by the coordinated movement of the shoulder rotating backward then forward, the elbow bending and extending, the wrist flicking to release, the hip twisting for power, and the opposite arm stabilizing for balance.
