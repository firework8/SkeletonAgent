Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Lowers and rotates slightly as arm extends.

4-right wrist: Flexes to align hand with the object.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes posture as right arm moves.  
6-left elbow: Slightly adjusts to maintain balance.  
8-right hip: Hinges forward to lower torso.  
11-left hip: Shifts weight to support bending motion.

Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks

4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description
