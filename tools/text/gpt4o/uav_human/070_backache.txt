Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'backache' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends forward at the waist, often with a slight arch in the lower back, while the hands may reach toward the affected area to rub or support it, indicating discomfort or pain.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'backache': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or leans to one side in discomfort.  
Hand: Presses against the lower back or rubs the painful area.  
Arm: Reaches backward or supports the torso when bending.  
Hip: Stiffens or shifts weight to relieve pressure.  
Leg: Stands with slight bend or adjusts stance for balance.  
Foot: Steps unevenly or shifts position to ease strain.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'backache' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Slightly hunches forward or tenses.  
5-left shoulder: Slightly hunches forward or tenses.  
8-right hip: Stiffens or shifts weight to relieve pain.  
11-left hip: Stiffens or shifts weight to relieve pain.  
3-right elbow: Bends slightly as hand reaches toward back.  
6-left elbow: Bends slightly as hand reaches toward back.  
4-right wrist: Flexes when pressing or rubbing the back.  
7-left wrist: Flexes when pressing or rubbing the back.

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'backache' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features of a backache action include hunched shoulders, stiff or shifting hips, elbows bending as hands reach toward the lower back, and wrists flexing while pressing or rubbing the painful area.
