Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'decelerate' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body decelerates by gradually reducing speed through controlled muscle contractions, shifting weight backward, and adjusting limb movements to counteract momentum.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'decelerate': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly back to counter forward momentum.  
Hand: May brace against a surface or relax grip to reduce speed.  
Arm: Extends or bends to help control balance and slow movement.  
Hip: Shifts backward to lower the center of gravity.  
Leg: Stiffens or shortens stride to absorb kinetic energy.  
Foot: Presses firmly into the ground to increase friction.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'decelerate' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Pulls slightly back to counter forward motion.  
3-right elbow: Bends to absorb momentum and stabilize arm.  
5-left shoulder: Pulls slightly back to balance deceleration force.  
6-left elbow: Bends to control arm movement and slow down.  
8-right hip: Shifts backward to lower center of gravity.  
11-left hip: Shifts backward to maintain balance during slowdown.  
9-right knee: Flexes to reduce stride length and absorb impact.  
12-left knee: Flexes to shorten step and aid braking.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'decelerate' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'decelerate' action is recognized by shoulders pulling back, elbows bending, hips shifting backward, and knees flexing to shorten strides and absorb momentum.
