Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'smoke' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'smoke' action by lifting the hand holding a cigarette to the mouth, inhaling deeply while drawing in smoke, then lowering the hand and exhaling the smoke through the mouth or nose.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'smoke': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or back as the person inhales.  
Hand: Holds the cigarette and brings it to the mouth.  
Arm: Bends at the elbow to lift the hand toward the face.  
Hip: Remains relaxed or shifts slightly for balance.  
Leg: Stays stationary or adjusts stance for comfort.  
Foot: Keeps flat or shifts weight between feet.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'smoke' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly as the arm raises the cigarette.  
3-right elbow: Bends to bring the hand toward the mouth.  
4-right wrist: Tilts to position the cigarette for inhalation.  
5-left shoulder: May stabilize or relax as the right arm moves.  
6-left elbow: Stays mostly still or adjusts for balance.  
7-left wrist: Remains relaxed or lightly supports posture.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'smoke' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'smoke' action is recognized by the dominant arm bending at the elbow to lift the hand holding a cigarette to the mouth while the shoulders and wrists adjust for positioning, with minimal movement from the non-dominant side.
