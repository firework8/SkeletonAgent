Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'sneeze' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body initiates a sneeze by inhaling deeply, then forcefully expelling air through the nose and mouth while the eyes reflexively close and muscles contract abruptly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'sneeze': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Jerks forward abruptly.  
Hand: May instinctively cover mouth or nose.  
Arm: Tenses briefly or remains relaxed.  
Hip: Stays stable with minimal movement.  
Leg: Maintains balance without shifting.  
Foot: Stays planted firmly on the ground.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'sneeze' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Jerks forward sharply during expulsion.  
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly with arm movement.  
3-right elbow: Flexes as hand moves toward face.  
4-right wrist: Bends to cover mouth or nose.  
5-left shoulder: Lifts slightly with arm movement.  
6-left elbow: Flexes as hand moves toward face.  
7-left wrist: Bends to cover mouth or nose.  
14-right eye: Closes reflexively during sneeze.  
15-left eye: Closes reflexively during sneeze.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'sneeze' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The sneeze action is recognized by a sharp forward jerk of the head, reflexive eye closure, and quick arm movements with elbows flexing and wrists bending as hands cover the nose or mouth.
