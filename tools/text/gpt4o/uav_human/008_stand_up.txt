Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'stand up' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body initiates the 'stand up' action by leaning forward to shift the center of gravity, then engages leg and core muscles to extend the knees and hips while stabilizing the torso into an upright position.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'stand up': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts forward then aligns upright with the spine.  
Hand: May press on a surface or rest lightly on thighs for balance.  
Arm: Engages to push off or stabilize, then relaxes by the sides.  
Hip: Hinges forward initially, then extends to straighten the torso.  
Leg: Muscles contract to extend knees and lift the body upward.  
Foot: Anchors firmly on the ground, shifting weight from heels to toes.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'stand up' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly as arms assist in pushing upward.  
3-right elbow: Extends or bends to support body leverage.  
5-left shoulder: Lifts slightly as arms assist in pushing upward.  
6-left elbow: Extends or bends to support body leverage.  
8-right hip: Hinges forward, then extends to straighten torso.  
9-right knee: Extends to lift the body upward.  
11-left hip: Hinges forward, then extends to straighten torso.  
12-left knee: Extends to lift the body upward.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'stand up' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'stand up' action is recognized by the shoulders and elbows assisting upward movement, hips hinging then extending, and knees straightening to lift the body.
