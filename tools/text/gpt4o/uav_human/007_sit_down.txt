Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'sit down' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends at the hips and knees while lowering the torso downward until the buttocks rest on a surface, maintaining balance through slight adjustments in posture and limb positioning.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'sit down': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or remains upright to maintain balance.  
Hand: May rest on thighs or a surface for support during descent.  
Arm: Relaxes or lightly braces against a surface to stabilize movement.  
Hip: Flexes as the torso lowers backward and downward.  
Leg: Bends at the knee to control the lowering motion.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground, distributing weight for stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'sit down' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Lowers slightly as torso bends forward.  
3-right elbow: Bends slightly for balance or support.  
5-left shoulder: Lowers slightly as torso bends forward.  
6-left elbow: Bends slightly for balance or support.  
8-right hip: Flexes backward to lower torso.  
9-right knee: Bends to control descent.  
11-left hip: Flexes backward to lower torso.  
12-left knee: Bends to control descent.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'sit down' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'sit down' action is recognized by the flexion of hips and knees to lower the torso, slight forward bending of the shoulders, and bending of elbows for balance or support.
