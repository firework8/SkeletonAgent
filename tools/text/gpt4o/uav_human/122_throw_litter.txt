Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'throw litter' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'throw litter' action by extending the arm outward, gripping the litter, swinging the arm backward for momentum, then swiftly propelling it forward while releasing the grip to discard the object.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'throw litter': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to look at the litter or target area.  
Hand: Grips the litter firmly before releasing it during the throw.  
Arm: Swings backward then forward to generate throwing force.  
Hip: Rotates slightly to add momentum to the throwing motion.  
Leg: Steps forward or shifts weight to stabilize the body.  
Foot: Adjusts stance to maintain balance during the throw.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'throw litter' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates backward then forward to initiate throw.  
3-right elbow: Bends during wind-up, extends sharply during release.  
4-right wrist: Flicks forward to propel litter upon release.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes body, may counterbalance right arm motion.  
6-left elbow: Slightly bends to maintain posture during throw.  
7-left wrist: Remains relaxed or assists in balance.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'throw litter' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'throw litter' action is recognized by a backward rotation and forward thrust of the throwing arm's shoulder, elbow extension, wrist flick, and stabilizing counter-movements from the opposite arm and lower body.
