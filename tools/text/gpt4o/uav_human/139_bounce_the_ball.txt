Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'bounce the ball' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends slightly at the knees and hips, then extends the legs and arms downward to propel the ball toward the ground, followed by a quick upward arm movement to catch the rebound.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'bounce the ball': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains steady with eyes tracking the ball.  
Hand: Opens to release the ball, then closes to catch it.  
Arm: Extends downward to push the ball, then lifts to receive it.  
Hip: Slightly bends and straightens to aid balance.  
Leg: Flexes at the knee to generate bounce force.  
Foot: Stays planted or shifts slightly for stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'bounce the ball' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates slightly forward during arm extension.  
3-right elbow: Flexes to lower, then extends to push the ball.  
4-right wrist: Flicks downward to release, then adjusts to catch.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes with minimal movement for balance.  
6-left elbow: Slightly bends to maintain posture.  
7-left wrist: Remains relaxed but ready to assist if needed.  
8-right hip: Shifts back slightly during knee bend.  
11-left hip: Mirrors right hip for stability.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'bounce the ball' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features include coordinated arm extension and wrist flick to propel the ball downward, slight hip and knee flexion for balance, and shoulder stabilization to guide the movement.
