Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'shooting goal (soccer)' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The player approaches the ball, plants their non-kicking foot beside it, swings their kicking leg back, then forcefully extends it forward to strike the ball toward the goal, following through with the motion to direct power and accuracy.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'shooting goal (soccer)': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Eyes focus on the ball and target while staying steady for balance.  
Hand: Non-dominant hand extends slightly for balance; dominant hand stays relaxed.  
Arm: Non-dominant arm swings outward for stability; dominant arm tucks slightly.  
Hip: Rotates forward to generate power as the kicking leg swings through.  
Leg: Plant leg bends slightly for stability; kicking leg swings back then accelerates forward.  
Foot: Plant foot points toward the target; kicking foot locks ankle and strikes the ball.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'shooting goal (soccer)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward during wind-up, then forward during kick for power.  
7-right shoulder: Balances arm swing opposite to kicking leg for stability.  
12-left hip: Drives forward to generate torque when kicking with right foot.  
13-right hip: Pivots and opens to allow full leg extension during follow-through.  
14-left knee: Stabilizes slightly bent as plant leg to support body weight.  
15-right knee: Flexes during backswing, then extends explosively to strike ball.  
16-left ankle: Locks firm as plant foot to anchor body during kick.  
17-right ankle: Flexes toes down and locks at impact for powerful strike.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'shooting goal (soccer)' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The shooting motion is recognized by the plant leg stabilizing with locked ankle and bent knee while the kicking hip drives forward, shoulder rotates for power, and the kicking leg explosively extends from knee flexion to full follow-through with ankle locked at impact.
