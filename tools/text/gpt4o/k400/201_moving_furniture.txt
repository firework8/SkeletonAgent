Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'moving furniture' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends at the knees and hips, grips the furniture firmly, engages core and leg muscles to lift, then steps carefully while maintaining balance to transport the furniture to the desired location.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'moving furniture': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly to monitor surroundings and maintain balance.  
Hand: Grips furniture firmly with fingers and palm for stability.  
Arm: Bends at the elbow and extends to lift or push the furniture.  
Hip: Pivots or shifts to adjust direction and support torso movement.  
Leg: Steps forward or backward to propel the body and furniture.  
Foot: Adjusts stance for traction and shifts weight during movement.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'moving furniture' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and stabilizes to support arm movements during lifting.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder motion for balanced force distribution.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to adjust grip height and generate lifting force.  
9-right elbow: Coordinates with left elbow for symmetrical lifting motion.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight and pivots to enable directional changes.  
13-right hip: Works with left hip to stabilize torso during movement.  
14-left knee: Bends to lower body and absorb weight during lifting.  
15-right knee: Extends to push upward when standing with furniture.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'moving furniture' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by synchronized shoulder and elbow flexion for lifting, coordinated hip pivoting for directional shifts, and alternating knee bending for weight transfer while maintaining torso stability.
