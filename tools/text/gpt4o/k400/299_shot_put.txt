Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'shot put' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The athlete starts in a crouched position, then explosively extends their legs, hips, and torso while pushing the shot forward with their arm, releasing it at the optimal angle for maximum distance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'shot put': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly away from the throw, then whips forward at release.  
Hand: Grips the shot firmly, pushes it upward and outward during release.  
Arm: Extends explosively forward and upward, driving the shot at release.  
Hip: Rotates backward initially, then thrusts forward forcefully to generate power.  
Leg: Drives powerfully off the ground, extending to propel the body forward.  
Foot: Pivots on the toe (glide technique) or steps forward (spin technique) for momentum.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'shot put' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward initially, then drives forward forcefully.  
7-right shoulder: Leads the throwing motion, extends upward at release.  
8-left elbow: Flexes during wind-up, extends to stabilize body rotation.  
9-right elbow: Drives forward explosively, straightens to propel the shot.  
12-left hip: Shifts back in preparation, thrusts forward for power transfer.  
13-right hip: Anchors rotation, then drives forward to generate momentum.  
18-mid hip: Initiates rotation, transfers force from legs to upper body.  
20-mid shoulder: Balances upper body, aligns with throwing direction.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'shot put' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The shot put is recognized by a forceful forward thrust of the hips and shoulders, a rapid extension of the throwing arm's elbow, and a full-body rotation that transfers power from the legs through the torso into the explosive release of the shot.
