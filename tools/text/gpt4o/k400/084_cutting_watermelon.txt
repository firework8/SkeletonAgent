Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cutting watermelon': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward to focus on the watermelon.  
Hand: Grips the knife firmly and guides the slicing motion.  
Arm: Raises and lowers the knife in a controlled arc.  
Hip: Stabilizes the torso to maintain balance.  
Leg: Slightly bent for stability and weight distribution.  
Foot: Flat on the ground, providing a steady base.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'cutting watermelon' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward to position the arm for cutting.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes while the left arm performs the slicing motion.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to raise and extend the knife during the downward cut.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts angle for precise blade alignment with the watermelon.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight slightly to maintain balance during the cutting motion.  
18-mid hip: Anchors torso stability while upper body moves.  
19-thorax: Maintains upright posture with slight forward lean for focus.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates bilateral shoulder movements for smooth cutting.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'cutting watermelon' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by the left shoulder and elbow driving a controlled downward arc with wrist precision, while the torso stabilizes with a slight forward lean and hip adjustments to balance the forceful slicing motion.
