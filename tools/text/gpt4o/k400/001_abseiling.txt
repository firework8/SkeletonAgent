Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'abseiling' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body descends vertically down a rope by leaning back, bending the knees slightly, and controlling the speed with one hand while the other maintains balance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'abseiling': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Looks forward or slightly down to monitor descent.  
Hand: One grips the rope for control while the other assists balance.  
Arm: Brake arm bends to regulate rope friction; guide arm stays loose.  
Hip: Leans back slightly to maintain body angle against the rope.  
Leg: Knees bend slightly, legs shoulder-width apart for stability.  
Foot: Pushes lightly against the surface to guide movement.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'abseiling' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to adjust rope tension.  
7-right shoulder: Balances movement, often more active than left.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to control brake-hand rope friction.  
9-right elbow: Maintains slight bend for stability and guidance.  
12-left hip: Leans back to counterbalance the descending motion.  
13-right hip: Aligns with left hip but may adjust for balance.  
14-left knee: Soft bend to absorb impact and control descent.  
15-right knee: Mirrors left knee, aiding in shock absorption.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'abseiling' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The abseiling action is recognized by the shoulders and elbows dynamically adjusting rope tension while the hips lean back and knees bend slightly to control a controlled vertical descent.
