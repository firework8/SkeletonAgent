Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'headbutting' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The headbutting action involves forcefully driving the forehead forward into a target by rapidly extending the neck and torso while keeping the legs grounded for stability.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'headbutting': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Thrusts forward sharply with neck extension to strike target.  
Hand: Typically clenched or open for balance, not primary in motion.  
Arm: May raise slightly for balance or remain at sides.  
Hip: Rotates or shifts forward to generate power.  
Leg: Stabilizes stance, often slightly bent for force transfer.  
Foot: Stays planted to ground for stability and leverage.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'headbutting' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Rapidly thrusts forward as the primary striking point.  
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward to add power to the headbutt.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates forward in sync with the left for balance.  
12-left hip: Drives forward to generate force from the lower body.  
13-right hip: Pushes forward to stabilize and enhance power.  
18-mid hip: Acts as a pivot for torso rotation during the strike.  
19-thorax: Leans forward to amplify momentum of the headbutt.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates upper-body movement for alignment.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'headbutting' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The headbutt is recognized by a sharp forward thrust of the head driven by synchronized torso rotation, hip propulsion, and shoulder alignment, with the nose as the striking point while the lower body stabilizes the forceful motion.
