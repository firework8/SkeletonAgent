Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cooking egg' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand reaches for the egg, cracks it against a surface, pours the contents into a pan, and stirs or flips it with a utensil until cooked.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cooking egg': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly to observe the pan.  
Hand: Grips spatula and flips the egg.  
Arm: Moves to crack egg into the pan.  
Hip: Shifts weight for balance while stirring.  
Leg: Adjusts stance for stability.  
Foot: Stays planted on the floor.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'cooking egg' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to extend arm toward pan.  
7-right shoulder: Lifts slightly to guide cracking motion.  
8-left elbow: Bends to control stirring or flipping.  
10-left wrist: Twists to pour or scrape egg from shell.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts angle for precise utensil handling.  
18-mid hip: Shifts weight for balance during cooking.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly to monitor the pan.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes upper body during arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'cooking egg' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotation guiding the arms, precise wrist control for cracking and flipping, subtle hip shifts for balance, and a forward-leaning thorax while monitoring the pan.
