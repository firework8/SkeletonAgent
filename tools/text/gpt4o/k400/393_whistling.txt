Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'whistling' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The lips purse, the tongue arches slightly, and controlled airflow passes through the narrowed opening to create a whistling sound.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'whistling': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or adjusts angle for airflow.  
Hand: May cup near mouth to amplify sound or remain still.  
Arm: Stays relaxed at the side or lightly bent if hand is raised.  
Hip: Remains stationary with balanced posture.  
Leg: Bears weight evenly, no active movement.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground, maintaining stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'whistling' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Slightly forward tilt to adjust airflow direction.  
6-left shoulder: Relaxed, may slightly rotate inward if arm moves.  
7-right shoulder: Relaxed, may slightly rotate inward if arm moves.  
8-left elbow: Stays bent if hand is raised, otherwise neutral.  
9-right elbow: Stays bent if hand is raised, otherwise neutral.  
10-left wrist: Neutral or slightly flexed if hand cups mouth.  
11-right wrist: Neutral or slightly flexed if hand cups mouth.  
19-thorax: Expands slightly for controlled breath support.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes posture for balanced upper body.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'whistling' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The whistling action is recognized by a slight forward head tilt, relaxed shoulders with potential inward rotation, controlled wrist flexion if hands are used, and subtle thorax expansion for breath support while maintaining stable posture.
