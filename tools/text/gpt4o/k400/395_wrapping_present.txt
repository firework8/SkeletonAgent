Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'wrapping present' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands grasp the wrapping paper, arms extend to pull it taut over the gift, fingers fold and tuck the edges, then secure with tape while the torso leans slightly forward for balance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'wrapping present': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to focus on the wrapping task.  
Hand: Grips and maneuvers paper, folds edges, and presses tape.  
Arm: Extends to pull paper, bends to adjust position, and reaches for supplies.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance while leaning.  
Leg: Adjusts stance to stabilize posture during wrapping.  
Foot: Stays planted to provide a steady base.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'wrapping present' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly inward as arms reach forward to pull paper.  
7-right shoulder: Lifts slightly when extending arm to smooth wrapping paper.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust hand position while folding edges.  
9-right elbow: Flexes when pressing tape or tucking paper corners.  
10-left wrist: Tilts and twists to manipulate paper with precision.  
11-right wrist: Moves fluidly to secure tape or hold gift steady.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance while leaning.  
13-right hip: Stabilizes posture as torso tilts forward slightly.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'wrapping present' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotations and elbow bends guiding precise wrist manipulations while subtle hip shifts stabilize the torso during forward-leaning paper-folding motions.
