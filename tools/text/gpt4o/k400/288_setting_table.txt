Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'setting table' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands grasp utensils, arms extend to place items on the table, torso leans slightly forward, and legs adjust stance for balance while moving around the table.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'setting table': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to look at table placement.  
Hand: Grasps and releases utensils or plates.  
Arm: Extends and retracts to position items.  
Hip: Shifts weight when reaching across the table.  
Leg: Steps sideways to move around the table.  
Foot: Adjusts stance for balance while standing.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'setting table' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts slightly when reaching across the table.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes while extending the arm to place items.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust hand position for precise placement.  
9-right elbow: Extends when placing objects on the far side of the table.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts angle to grip and release items smoothly.  
11-right wrist: Fine-tunes control when setting down utensils or plates.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight when stepping sideways around the table.  
13-right hip: Supports balance while leaning forward to reach.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'setting table' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotations and elbow extensions for precise item placement, paired with subtle hip shifts for balance and wrist adjustments for controlled release of objects.
