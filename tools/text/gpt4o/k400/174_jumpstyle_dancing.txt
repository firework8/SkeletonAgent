Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'jumpstyle dancing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The 'jumpstyle dancing' involves rapid, alternating leg kicks and hops, with the knees lifted high while the upper body remains relatively still, often synchronized to fast-paced electronic music.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'jumpstyle dancing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slight forward tilt or steady, minimal movement.  
Hand: Often relaxed or slightly clenched, swinging with arm motions.  
Arm: Swings forward and backward, sometimes bent at the elbow.  
Hip: Twists slightly with leg movements but mostly stable.  
Leg: Rapidly alternates between high knee lifts and kicks.  
Foot: Lands flat or on the ball, quickly rebounds for next jump.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'jumpstyle dancing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly swings forward and back with arm motions.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, aiding arm swing coordination.  
14-left knee: Rapidly lifts high, driving upward momentum.  
15-right knee: Alternates with left knee in fast, rhythmic kicks.  
16-left ankle: Flexes sharply to propel jumps and landings.  
17-right ankle: Syncs with left ankle for quick rebound steps.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'jumpstyle dancing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Jumpstyle dancing is recognized by rapid alternating high knee lifts with sharp ankle rebounds, synchronized shoulder-guided arm swings, creating a fast-paced, bouncy motion driven by the legs.
