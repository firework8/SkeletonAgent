Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'tasting food' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand lifts the food to the mouth, which opens to receive it; the tongue moves the food around, sensing texture and flavor, while the jaw chews and the throat swallows.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'tasting food': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward as the mouth opens to receive food.  
Hand: Grasps utensils or food, bringing it toward the mouth.  
Arm: Flexes at the elbow to move the hand toward the face.  
Hip: Remains stable, supporting upper body posture.  
Leg: Stays still, maintaining seated or standing balance.  
Foot: Rests flat or adjusts slightly for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'tasting food' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward to aid arm movement.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or assists in utensil control.  
8-left elbow: Bends to bring hand closer to mouth.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to adjust utensil or food position.  
10-left wrist: Tilts for precise food handling.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts angle for cutting or scooping.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly to reach food.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns posture for balanced movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'tasting food' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by forward shoulder rotation, elbow flexion bringing hands toward the mouth, precise wrist adjustments for food handling, and slight thoracic lean—all coordinated in a controlled upper-body motion distinct from other reaching actions.
