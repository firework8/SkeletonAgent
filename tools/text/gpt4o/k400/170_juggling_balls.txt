Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'juggling balls' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands alternately toss balls upward in a rhythmic pattern while the eyes track their movement, and the arms and wrists adjust to catch and redirect each ball smoothly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'juggling balls': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly to track ball movement with the eyes.  
Hand: Opens to release and closes to catch balls in quick succession.  
Arm: Moves in controlled arcs to toss and position for catches.  
Hip: Shifts subtly for balance but remains mostly stable.  
Leg: Adjusts stance lightly to maintain stability, rarely bending.  
Foot: Stays planted or steps lightly to reposition as needed.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'juggling balls' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to aid arm movement during tosses and catches.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, rotating to support throwing and catching.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to control toss height and catch timing.  
9-right elbow: Adjusts similarly to left elbow for coordinated juggling rhythm.  
10-left wrist: Flicks precisely to release balls and adjusts for smooth catches.  
11-right wrist: Matches left wrist motion for balanced ball control.  
19-thorax: Stabilizes torso to maintain posture while arms move dynamically.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors arm movements, ensuring symmetry in juggling motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'juggling balls' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The synchronized alternating flick of the wrists, controlled elbow flexing, and slight shoulder rotation create a rhythmic tossing-and-catching pattern while the torso remains stable for balance.
