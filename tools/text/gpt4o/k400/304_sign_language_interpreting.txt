Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'sign language interpreting' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands and arms move fluidly, fingers shaping precise signs while facial expressions and subtle body shifts convey tone and context.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'sign language interpreting': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts or nods slightly to emphasize meaning.  
Hand: Forms precise shapes and movements for signs.  
Arm: Moves smoothly to position hands in signing space.  
Hip: Remains mostly stable with slight weight shifts.  
Leg: Maintains balance with minimal movement.  
Foot: Stays planted or adjusts stance for comfort.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'sign language interpreting' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts slightly to position the arm for signing.  
7-right shoulder: Adjusts to support fluid arm movements during interpretation.  
8-left elbow: Bends and extends to control hand positioning and sign articulation.  
9-right elbow: Flexes dynamically to facilitate precise right-hand signing.  
10-left wrist: Articulates signs with controlled bends and rotations.  
11-right wrist: Moves sharply or smoothly depending on sign emphasis.  
19-thorax: Shifts subtly to aid balance and upper body coordination.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors posture while allowing slight torso adjustments.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'sign language interpreting' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Sign language interpreting is recognized by the fluid, precise coordination of shoulders, elbows, and wrists shaping signs, with subtle torso adjustments maintaining balance while hands articulate meaning through controlled movements.
