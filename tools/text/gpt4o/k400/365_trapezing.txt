Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'trapezing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The 'trapezing' action involves the body swinging from a suspended bar, using momentum to propel forward or backward while maintaining grip and control.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'trapezing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly back or forward to maintain balance during the swing.  
Hand: Grips the bar firmly, adjusting pressure as momentum shifts.  
Arm: Extends and bends to control swing direction and power.  
Hip: Shifts forward or backward to generate momentum.  
Leg: Extends or bends to aid in propulsion and stability.  
Foot: Points or flexes to streamline movement and assist balance.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'trapezing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts to support swinging momentum.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates and lifts in sync with the left for balance.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to control swing power.  
9-right elbow: Flexes and extends in coordination with the left.  
12-left hip: Shifts forward/backward to drive swing direction.  
13-right hip: Mirrors left hip movement for fluid motion.  
18-mid hip: Anchors core stability during swings.  
20-mid shoulder: Maintains upper-body alignment with the bar.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'trapezing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The 'trapezing' action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotation and elbow flexion driving the swing, synchronized with rhythmic hip shifts for momentum, while the core maintains stability to keep the body aligned with the bar.
