Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing cricket' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The player stands with knees slightly bent, grips the bat, shifts weight to the back foot as the ball approaches, swings the bat forward with a rotating torso, transfers weight to the front foot, and follows through with the arms extending toward the target area.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing cricket': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tracks the ball with focused gaze while maintaining balance.  
Hand: Grips the bat firmly and adjusts for shot control.  
Arm: Swings the bat with controlled power, extending forward or upward.  
Hip: Rotates to generate force during the swing and follow-through.  
Leg: Shifts weight between front and back foot for stability and power.  
Foot: Pivots or steps forward to align with the ball's trajectory.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing cricket' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward during backlift, then forward during swing.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes posture while guiding bat swing direction.  
8-left elbow: Flexes during backlift, extends forcefully during forward swing.  
9-right elbow: Maintains controlled bend, adjusting for shot precision.  
10-left wrist: Hinges to angle bat face, snaps for power in follow-through.  
11-right wrist: Firms grip while allowing slight flexibility for shot control.  
12-left hip: Initiates weight transfer, rotates to generate swing power.  
13-right hip: Anchors stance, supports rotation and balance.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing cricket' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The cricket batting action is recognized by a coordinated weight shift from back to front hip, a powerful shoulder-driven bat swing with elbow extension, precise wrist control for bat angle, and a stable yet rotating torso for balance and follow-through.
