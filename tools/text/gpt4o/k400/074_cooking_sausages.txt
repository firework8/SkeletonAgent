Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cooking sausages' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cooking sausages': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to watch the sausages.  
Hand: Grips the spatula and flips sausages with quick wrist flicks.  
Arm: Moves the spatula in short, controlled arcs over the pan.  
Hip: Shifts weight slightly to maintain balance while standing.  
Leg: Bears body weight with knees slightly bent for stability.  
Foot: Stays planted or adjusts stance to reach the pan.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'cooking sausages' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to guide arm movement while stirring or flipping.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes as the dominant arm manipulates the spatula.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust stance or assist in balancing near the stove.  
9-right elbow: Flexes and extends to control spatula motion while cooking.  
10-left wrist: Remains mostly steady, occasionally adjusting grip on pan handle.  
11-right wrist: Flicks precisely to flip sausages with the spatula.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight subtly for balance during cooking.  
13-right hip: Supports posture while standing and leaning toward the stove.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'cooking sausages' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is characterized by precise wrist flicks for flipping, controlled elbow bends for spatula maneuvering, subtle shoulder rotations for arm guidance, and slight hip shifts for balance while maintaining a forward-leaning posture over the stove.
