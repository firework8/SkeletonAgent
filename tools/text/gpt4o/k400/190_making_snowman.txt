Based on the movement process of the 'making snowman' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward to extend arm for snow gathering.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or mirrors left shoulder for balance.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust hand height when rolling snow.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to assist in shaping or placing snowballs.  
10-left wrist: Articulates to press and mold snow details.  
11-right wrist: Mirrors left wrist for symmetrical snowman-building.

Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'making snowman' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated forward hinging of the hips, alternating shoulder rotations with elbow flexion for snow rolling, and precise wrist articulation for stacking and detailing, all while maintaining a balanced crouch posture.
