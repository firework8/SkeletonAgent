Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'country line dancing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief

2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly lifted with eyes forward or occasionally tilted during turns.  
Hand: Often held at waist level or clapping, sometimes swinging loosely.  
Arm: Gently extended or bent at the elbow, occasionally swinging in sync with steps.  
Hip: Subtly swaying side to side or shifting weight with steps.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'country line dancing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Subtle forward/backward swing with arm movements.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, maintaining balance during steps.  
12-left hip: Sways side-to-side, shifting weight during steps.  
13-right hip: Alternates with left hip, creating rhythmic hip motion.  
16-left ankle: Pivots or taps during heel-toe and shuffle steps.  
17-right ankle: Complements left ankle in quick footwork patterns.  
18-mid hip: Central pivot point for hip sways and turns.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes upper body during coordinated arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'country line dancing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Country line dancing is recognized by rhythmic hip sways alternating sides, synchronized shoulder swings, precise ankle pivots in heel-toe steps, and stable mid-body rotation guiding smooth turns and footwork patterns.
