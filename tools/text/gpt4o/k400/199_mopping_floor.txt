Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'mopping floor' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends slightly at the waist, grips the mop handle with both hands, and moves it back and forth in rhythmic, sweeping motions while shifting weight between the feet to cover the floor area.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'mopping floor': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward with eyes focused on the floor.  
Hand: Grips the mop handle firmly, applying pressure for sweeping.  
Arm: Moves back and forth in controlled, rhythmic pushes and pulls.  
Hip: Swivels slightly to extend reach and adjust body position.  
Leg: Alternates between bending and straightening to shift weight.  
Foot: Steps forward or backward in small, coordinated movements.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'mopping floor' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to extend reach during sweeping.  
7-right shoulder: Moves forward and back to guide the mop.  
8-left elbow: Bends and straightens to control mop pressure.  
9-right elbow: Flexes rhythmically for push-pull motion.  
12-left hip: Swivels to adjust body position while mopping.  
13-right hip: Shifts weight to stabilize movement.  
14-left knee: Alternates between bent and straight for balance.  
15-right knee: Supports weight shifts during forward-backward steps.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'mopping floor' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The mopping floor action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotations guiding the mop, rhythmic elbow bends for push-pull strokes, hip swivels adjusting reach, and alternating knee bends stabilizing weight shifts during sweeping motions.
