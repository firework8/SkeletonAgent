Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'biking through snow' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The rider leans forward, pedaling steadily with legs pushing through resistance, while arms grip the handlebars to maintain balance as the bike tires plow through the snowy terrain.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'biking through snow': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward, eyes focused ahead on the snowy path.  
Hand: Grips handlebars firmly, fingers adjusting pressure for control.  
Arm: Slightly bent, absorbing shocks while steering through uneven snow.  
Hip: Shifts subtly to maintain balance as the bike tires slide or sink.  
Leg: Pushes down forcefully on pedals to power through resistance.  
Foot: Presses firmly on pedals, toes pointing slightly downward for leverage.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'biking through snow' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward with each pedal stroke for balance.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, stabilizing upper body against snow resistance.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to absorb shocks while steering.  
9-right elbow: Works with left elbow to maintain handlebar control on uneven terrain.  
12-left hip: Shifts downward slightly when left leg pushes the pedal.  
13-right hip: Lowers as right leg drives power into the pedal stroke.  
14-left knee: Bends and extends forcefully to power through snow resistance.  
15-right knee: Alternates with left knee, driving pedals with strong downward motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'biking through snow' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by strong alternating knee extensions driving the pedals, synchronized hip shifts for balance, slightly forward-rotating shoulders for stability, and flexed elbows absorbing shocks while steering through resistance.
