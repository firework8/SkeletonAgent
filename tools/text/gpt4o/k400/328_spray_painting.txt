Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'spray painting' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body moves the arm in controlled, sweeping motions while the wrist adjusts the spray can's angle, maintaining consistent distance from the surface to evenly distribute paint.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'spray painting': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to observe the spray pattern and surface.  
Hand: Grips the can and presses the nozzle while adjusting tilt.  
Arm: Moves in smooth, controlled arcs to apply paint evenly.  
Hip: Shifts weight to stabilize posture during arm movements.  
Leg: Steps forward or back to adjust distance from the surface.  
Foot: Anchors the body or pivots to aid in directional changes.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'spray painting' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts slightly to guide arm movement.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing controlled arm extension.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to adjust spray distance.  
9-right elbow: Bends smoothly for precise spray can control.  
10-left wrist: Tilts and steadies for directional paint flow.  
11-right wrist: Presses nozzle and adjusts can angle.  
18-mid hip: Shifts weight to maintain balance during motion.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly for better surface reach.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'spray painting' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The spray painting action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotation, controlled elbow flexion, precise wrist tilting, and subtle upper-body lean, creating smooth arcing arm motions while maintaining steady hand pressure on the nozzle.
