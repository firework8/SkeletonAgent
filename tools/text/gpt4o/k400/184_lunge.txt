Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'lunge' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The lunge begins with one foot stepping forward while the other remains stationary, bending both knees to lower the hips until the front thigh is parallel to the ground, then pushing back to the starting position.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'lunge': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Stays upright and aligned with the spine.  
Hand: May hold weights or rest on hips for balance.  
Arm: Remains straight if holding weights or bent if hands are on hips.  
Hip: Lowers vertically while maintaining stability.  
Leg: Front knee bends to 90°, back knee lowers toward the ground.  
Foot: Front foot stays flat, back foot remains on the ball with heel lifted.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'lunge' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
12-left hip: Lowers vertically while maintaining alignment with the front leg.  
13-right hip: Extends backward as the knee lowers toward the ground.  
14-left knee: Bends to 90° with the shin near vertical.  
15-right knee: Flexes as it lowers toward the floor without touching.  
16-left ankle: Remains stable with foot flat on the ground.  
17-right ankle: Stays dorsiflexed with heel lifted.  
18-mid hip: Shifts slightly forward to maintain balance.  
19-thorax: Stays upright and centered over the hips.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'lunge' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The lunge is recognized by the forward hip lowering with the front knee bent at 90° while the back knee nears the ground, ankles stabilizing in a split stance, and the torso remaining upright over the hips.
