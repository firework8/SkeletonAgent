Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing cello' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The player sits upright, presses fingers on strings with one hand while the other draws the bow across, creating vibrations that resonate through the cello's body.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing cello': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or to the side, aligning with the cello's neck.  
Hand: Left fingers press strings precisely; right hand grips and moves the bow.  
Arm: Left arm extends and adjusts; right arm guides bow with controlled strokes.  
Hip: Anchors posture, remaining stable against the cello's lower curve.  
Leg: Knees gently brace the cello, maintaining instrument balance.  
Foot: Right foot may shift slightly for stability; left stays planted.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing cello' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly raised and rotated forward to support left arm positioning.  
7-right shoulder: Moves fluidly to guide bowing arm with controlled horizontal motion.  
8-left elbow: Bent outward to allow finger placement on strings with precision.  
9-right elbow: Flexes and extends smoothly to drive bow across strings.  
10-left wrist: Curved inward for finger agility and accurate note articulation.  
11-right wrist: Subtle pivots adjust bow angle and pressure on strings.  
12-left hip: Anchors posture, stabilizing against the cello’s lower body.  
13-right hip: Balanced to maintain seated stability during dynamic bowing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing cello' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The cellist's left shoulder and elbow position the arm for precise finger placement while the right shoulder, elbow, and wrist execute fluid bowing motions, all anchored by stable hips maintaining seated balance against the instrument.
