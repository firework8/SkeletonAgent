Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'sweeping floor' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The body bends slightly at the waist, arms extend to grip the broom, and a rhythmic back-and-forth motion is performed with the wrists and shoulders while stepping forward gradually to cover the floor area.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'sweeping floor': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward with eyes focused on the floor.  
Hand: Grips the broom handle firmly, with fingers adjusting pressure during sweeping.  
Arm: Moves back and forth in controlled arcs, driving the broom’s motion.  
Hip: Swivels slightly to shift weight and extend reach while sweeping.  
Leg: Steps forward or sideways in small strides to cover new areas.  
Foot: Alternates weight distribution to stabilize and propel movement.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'sweeping floor' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to extend arm reach during sweeping.  
7-right shoulder: Moves forward and back to drive the broom's motion.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to control broom angle and force.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts grip and angle for precise sweeping strokes.  
11-right wrist: Guides broom direction with subtle tilting movements.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight to stabilize posture while stepping.  
13-right hip: Rotates slightly to aid forward movement.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point for torso rotation during sweeping.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'sweeping floor' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The sweeping floor action is recognized by coordinated shoulder-driven arm arcs with wrist adjustments guiding the broom, synchronized with subtle hip rotations and weight shifts to maintain balance while stepping forward.
