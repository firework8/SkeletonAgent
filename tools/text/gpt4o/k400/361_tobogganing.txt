Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'tobogganing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body crouches low, leans slightly backward, and slides down a slope on a toboggan, using legs and hands for balance and steering while maintaining a streamlined posture to minimize friction and maximize speed.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'tobogganing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or back to maintain balance and visibility.  
Hand: Grips the toboggan edges or pushes off for steering and speed control.  
Arm: Extends or bends to stabilize and adjust body position while sliding.  
Hip: Shifts weight side to side to steer and maintain balance on the toboggan.  
Leg: Bends at the knees, pressing against the toboggan for stability and control.  
Foot: Flexes or points to aid in balance and steering adjustments.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'tobogganing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lowers and stabilizes to maintain balance while leaning back.  
7-right shoulder: Lowers and stabilizes to maintain balance while leaning back.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight left or right to steer the toboggan.  
13-right hip: Shifts weight left or right to steer the toboggan.  
14-left knee: Bent to absorb bumps and maintain a crouched position.  
15-right knee: Bent to absorb bumps and maintain a crouched position.  
18-mid hip: Acts as a pivot point for weight distribution and steering.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors upper body stability while leaning backward.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'tobogganing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Tobogganing is recognized by a crouched posture with bent knees absorbing terrain, hips dynamically shifting weight for steering, and shoulders lowered in a backward lean while arms stabilize grip on the sled.
