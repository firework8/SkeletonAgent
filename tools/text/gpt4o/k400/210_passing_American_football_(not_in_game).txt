3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to track the target before the throw.  
Hand: Grips the ball firmly, fingers spread over the laces, then snaps wrist on release.  
Arm: Draws back, then drives forward in a quick, overhand motion.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'passing American football (not in game)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward during wind-up, then forward during throw.  
7-right shoulder: Drives forward forcefully to propel the ball.  
8-left elbow: Bends slightly for balance, stabilizes during motion.  
9-right elbow: Flexes back in wind-up, extends sharply on release.  
10-left wrist: Minimal movement, maintains loose stability.  
11-right wrist: Snaps forward on release to create spiral.  
12-left hip: Rotates forward to generate torque.  
13-right hip: Pivots slightly as weight shifts forward.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'passing American football (not in game)' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The passing motion is characterized by a forceful forward drive of the throwing shoulder and elbow, a sharp wrist snap upon release, coordinated hip rotation for torque, and a stabilizing step with the lead leg while the torso pivots to generate power.
