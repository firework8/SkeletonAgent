Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'slacklining' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs slacklining by balancing on a tensioned line, using slight arm movements and subtle leg adjustments to maintain stability while walking or standing, with the core engaged to counteract wobbling.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'slacklining': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts to adjust balance, gaze fixed forward or downward.  
Hand: Fingers subtly splay or curl for stability, palms face inward or down.  
Arm: Gently extends or bends at the elbow, aiding counterbalance.  
Hip: Shifts laterally to compensate for line wobbling, maintaining center.  
Leg: Alternates between slight bends and straightening to absorb movement.  
Foot: Rolls slightly inward or outward, toes gripping for control.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'slacklining' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly raises and lowers to counterbalance body sway.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, adjusting for arm positioning.  
12-left hip: Shifts laterally to stabilize against line movement.  
13-right hip: Balances with left hip, maintaining torso alignment.  
14-left knee: Flexes and extends to absorb vibrations from the line.  
15-right knee: Coordinates with left knee for smooth weight transitions.  
16-left ankle: Rolls slightly to adjust foot pressure on the line.  
17-right ankle: Stabilizes foot placement, aiding quick micro-corrections.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'slacklining' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Slacklining is recognized by coordinated lateral hip shifts, subtle shoulder counterbalances, dynamic knee flexing to absorb wobbles, and precise ankle adjustments maintaining stability on the tensioned line.
