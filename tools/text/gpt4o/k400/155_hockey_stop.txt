Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'hockey stop' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hockey stop involves the skater quickly turning their hips and shoulders perpendicular to the direction of travel, digging the edges of their skates into the ice at an angle to create friction, and shifting their weight backward to decelerate abruptly while maintaining balance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'hockey stop': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns to look in the direction of the stop.  
Hand: Holds the stick firmly, often bracing for balance.  
Arm: Extends slightly outward to help stabilize the body.  
Hip: Rotates sharply to align sideways against momentum.  
Leg: Bends deeply to lower center of gravity.  
Foot: Angles skates aggressively to dig edges into the ice.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'hockey stop' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates inward to help twist the torso sideways.  
7-right shoulder: Pulls back slightly to counterbalance the stop.  
12-left hip: Drives downward and outward to initiate the edge angle.  
13-right hip: Pushes forward to align the body perpendicular to motion.  
14-left knee: Deeply flexed to absorb force and maintain stability.  
15-right knee: Slightly bent but stiffens to support weight shift.  
16-left ankle: Sharply tilts inward to dig inside edge into the ice.  
17-right ankle: Angles outward to engage outside edge for braking.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'hockey stop' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The hockey stop is recognized by a sharp sideways torso twist with hips perpendicular to motion, deep knee flexion for stability, and aggressive ankle angulation to dig skate edges into the ice while shoulders counterbalance the abrupt deceleration.
