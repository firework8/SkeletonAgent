Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'weaving basket' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The arms alternately cross and uncross in front of the torso while the hands mimic weaving motions, with slight torso twists and coordinated foot shifts for balance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'weaving basket': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts side to side with arm movements.  
Hand: Fingers flex and weave in alternating crossing motions.  
Arm: Alternately crosses and uncrosses in front of the torso.  
Hip: Sways gently to counterbalance arm movements.  
Leg: Lightly shifts weight side to side for stability.  
Foot: Adjusts stance subtly to maintain balance.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'weaving basket' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward and back during arm crossings.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder with opposing rotation.  
8-left elbow: Bends and extends as arm crosses torso.  
9-right elbow: Alternates flexion/extension opposite left elbow.  
10-left wrist: Twists slightly during weaving hand motions.  
11-right wrist: Mirrors left wrist with opposing twists.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight subtly to aid balance.  
13-right hip: Adjusts stance in sync with left hip.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'weaving basket' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The weaving basket action is recognized by alternating shoulder rotations driving crossed-arm motions with synchronized wrist twists and subtle hip shifts for balance.
