Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'ski jumping' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The skier crouches low, accelerates down the ramp, extends upward at the takeoff, leans forward in mid-air with arms back, and lands in a telemark stance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'ski jumping': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to maintain balance and aerodynamics.  
Hand: Grips ski poles loosely before takeoff, then extends backward in flight.  
Arm: Stays close to the body initially, then swings back for stability mid-air.  
Hip: Flexes deeply in crouch, extends sharply at takeoff, then leans forward in flight.  
Leg: Explodes upward at takeoff, stays extended in flight, bends slightly for landing.  
Foot: Presses firmly into ski bindings, angles toes slightly upward during flight.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'ski jumping' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Pulls back slightly during takeoff, stabilizes mid-flight.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, aids in balance during extension.  
12-left hip: Drives upward at takeoff, shifts forward in flight.  
13-right hip: Coordinates with left hip for explosive extension.  
14-left knee: Flexes deeply in crouch, extends fully at takeoff.  
15-right knee: Synchronizes with left knee for powerful jump.  
16-left ankle: Maintains rigid angle for ski control in air.  
17-right ankle: Stabilizes landing with slight flexion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'ski jumping' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The ski jumping action is recognized by a deep crouch with flexed knees and hips, explosive upward extension at takeoff, forward-leaning shoulder and hip alignment mid-flight, and rigid ankle control before a slightly flexed landing stance.
