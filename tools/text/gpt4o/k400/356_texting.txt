Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'texting' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The fingers tap the phone screen while the thumbs move swiftly to type, the wrists remain slightly bent, and the eyes focus on the display as the head tilts forward.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'texting': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts forward slightly with eyes fixed on the phone screen.  
Hand: Fingers and thumbs tap rapidly on the phone's touchscreen.  
Arm: Bends at the elbow to hold the phone steady at chest or waist level.  
Hip: Remains stationary or shifts slightly for balance if standing.  
Leg: Stays relaxed if sitting or bears weight if standing.  
Foot: Rests flat if seated or adjusts stance for stability if standing.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'texting' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly raised and rotated inward to position the arm for phone holding.  
7-right shoulder: Slightly raised and rotated inward to stabilize the phone with the other hand.  
8-left elbow: Bent at ~90 degrees to bring the phone closer to the body.  
9-right elbow: Bent at ~90 degrees to support the phone or assist in typing.  
10-left wrist: Flexed to angle the phone for better screen visibility.  
11-right wrist: Flexed or extended for thumb movement during typing.  
19-thorax: Slightly hunched forward as the upper body leans toward the phone.  
20-mid shoulder: Tilted forward to align with the head and arm positioning.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'texting' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The texting action is recognized by slightly hunched thorax, forward-tilted shoulders, bent elbows stabilizing the phone, and flexed wrists enabling rapid thumb movements while the head tilts downward.
