Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing trumpet' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body brings the trumpet to the lips, presses the mouthpiece firmly, inhales deeply, then exhales while fingers press valves to alter pitch, creating sound through vibrating lips and controlled breath.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing trumpet': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to position lips against the mouthpiece.  
Hand: Fingers press and release valves to change notes.  
Arm: Holds the trumpet steady with elbows slightly bent.  
Hip: Remains stable to support upper body posture.  
Leg: Bears weight evenly while standing or stays grounded if seated.  
Foot: Stays flat on the floor for balance, slightly apart if standing.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing trumpet' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts slightly to support trumpet weight and stabilize arm.  
7-right shoulder: Holds steady with minor adjustments for proper trumpet angle.  
8-left elbow: Bends to position left hand on valves while maintaining stability.  
9-right elbow: Stays slightly bent to balance trumpet and aid breath control.  
10-left wrist: Rotates subtly for precise finger placement on valve buttons.  
11-right wrist: Remains firm but flexible to support trumpet's leadpipe.  
19-thorax: Expands and contracts with controlled breathing for sustained airflow.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors posture, aligning upper body for optimal playing position.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing trumpet' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by lifted shoulders stabilizing bent elbows, precise wrist adjustments for valve control, anchored mid-shoulder posture, and coordinated thorax expansion for breath support while maintaining minimal head tilt.
