Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'massaging legs' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands press and knead the legs using circular or linear motions, alternating between palms and fingers to apply varying pressure while moving along the thigh or calf muscles.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'massaging legs': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: May tilt slightly forward or side-to-side to observe the legs.  
Hand: Presses, kneads, or glides along the leg muscles with fingers or palms.  
Arm: Moves rhythmically to apply pressure, bending at the elbow for control.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to adjust balance while leaning over the legs.  
Leg: Remains stationary or adjusts position to aid access for the hands.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground or shifts to stabilize the body.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'massaging legs' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and adjusts to position the arm for effective pressure.  
7-right shoulder: Moves to align the arm with the leg for smooth strokes.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to control hand pressure and motion.  
9-right elbow: Bends to modulate force during kneading or gliding.  
10-left wrist: Articulates to direct palm or finger contact points.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts angle for precise finger or palm pressure application.  
12-left hip: Shifts slightly to maintain balance while leaning forward.  
13-right hip: Stabilizes posture during weight transfer for consistent pressure.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'massaging legs' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The massaging legs action is characterized by coordinated shoulder and elbow adjustments guiding rhythmic wrist articulation, with stabilizing hip shifts ensuring controlled hand pressure along the legs while maintaining upper body posture.
