Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cleaning gutters' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The person reaches upward with one hand to clear debris from the gutter while maintaining balance, possibly using a ladder for support, then repeats the motion with the other hand or a tool to remove remaining dirt.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cleaning gutters': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts upward to visually track debris in the gutter.  
Hand: Grips a tool or scrapes debris with fingers.  
Arm: Extends upward to reach into the gutter.  
Hip: Shifts slightly to maintain balance while reaching.  
Leg: Adjusts stance for stability, often bent if on a ladder.  
Foot: Presses firmly on the ladder rung or ground for support.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'cleaning gutters' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts and rotates to extend arm upward.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or assists in reaching motion.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust reach height when scraping debris.  
10-left wrist: Flexes to angle tool or hand for gutter cleaning.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight to maintain balance during reach.  
18-mid hip: Anchors torso for stability on ladder or ground.  
19-thorax: Rotates slightly to extend reach toward gutter.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates bilateral arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'cleaning gutters' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by upward arm extension with shoulder rotation, coordinated torso stabilization, and subtle hip shifts for balance while maintaining a fixed gaze toward the gutter.
