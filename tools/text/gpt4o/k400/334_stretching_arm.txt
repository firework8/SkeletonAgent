Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'stretching arm' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The arm extends outward from the shoulder, muscles lengthening as the hand moves away from the body, fingers often reaching or spreading slightly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'stretching arm': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: May tilt slightly or remain neutral to maintain balance.  
Hand: Fingers extend or spread as the palm faces outward or upward.  
Arm: Extends straight or at an angle from the shoulder, muscles lengthening.  
Hip: Stays stable or shifts slightly to counterbalance the arm movement.  
Leg: Remains grounded or adjusts stance to support upper body motion.  
Foot: Stays planted flat or shifts weight to maintain stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'stretching arm' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward as the arm extends outward.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates slightly forward as the arm extends outward.  
8-left elbow: Straightens fully or partially depending on stretch intensity.  
9-right elbow: Straightens fully or partially depending on stretch intensity.  
10-left wrist: Extends with fingers spread or relaxed during the reach.  
11-right wrist: Extends with fingers spread or relaxed during the reach.  
19-thorax: Stabilizes or twists minimally to support arm movement.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors posture, aligning both shoulders during extension.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'stretching arm' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The stretching arm action is recognized by symmetrical forward shoulder rotation with elbow extension, wrist and finger relaxation, and minimal stabilizing adjustments in the thorax and mid-shoulder while maintaining overall posture.
