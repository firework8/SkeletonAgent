Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'rock climbing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body alternately grips and pulls with the hands while pushing with the legs to ascend a vertical surface, maintaining balance and coordination throughout the movement.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'rock climbing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Looks upward or sideways to plan the next hold.  
Hand: Grips or releases holds with precise finger tension.  
Arm: Pulls or pushes to lift or stabilize the body.  
Hip: Rotates and shifts to maintain balance and reach.  
Leg: Extends or bends to push the body upward.  
Foot: Steps or presses on holds for support and leverage.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'rock climbing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts to reach upward holds.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or pulls to assist body movement.  
8-left elbow: Flexes or extends to adjust grip distance.  
9-right elbow: Pushes or pulls to generate upward force.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts angle for optimal grip on holds.  
11-right wrist: Maintains tension to secure hand position.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight to aid balance and reach.  
13-right hip: Twists to extend leg for foothold leverage.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'rock climbing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Rock climbing is recognized by alternating shoulder rotations and elbow flexions driving upward pulls, synchronized with precise wrist adjustments for grip stability and dynamic hip shifts for balance during vertical ascent.
