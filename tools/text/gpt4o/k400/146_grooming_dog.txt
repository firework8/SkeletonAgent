The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'grooming dog' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward to extend arm toward the dog.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or adjusts posture for balance during grooming.  
8-left elbow: Bends and extends to control hand movements while brushing.  
10-left wrist: Flexes smoothly to guide grooming strokes.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain stability while leaning.  
18-mid hip: Tilts forward slightly as the torso bends toward the dog.  
19-thorax: Leans forward to reach the dog comfortably.  
20-mid shoulder: Adjusts posture to coordinate arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'grooming dog' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by a forward-leaning torso with coordinated arm movements—smooth elbow bends guiding wrist strokes while shoulders and hips subtly adjust for stability and reach toward the dog.
