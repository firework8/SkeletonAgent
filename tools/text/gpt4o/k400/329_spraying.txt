Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'spraying' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'spraying' action by extending the arm forward, gripping the sprayer, and moving the hand or fingers in a controlled motion to release a mist or stream of liquid.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'spraying': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to aim eyes at the target area.  
Hand: Squeezes the trigger or presses the nozzle to release spray.  
Arm: Extends forward or sweeps side-to-side to direct the spray.  
Hip: Shifts weight slightly for balance or to adjust spraying angle.  
Leg: Stays stable or steps forward/backward for better reach.  
Foot: Anchors the body or adjusts stance for stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'spraying' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward to extend the arm.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or assists in arm extension if spraying with the right hand.  
8-left elbow: Bends or extends to adjust spraying distance and angle.  
9-right elbow: Remains slightly bent for balance or aids in two-handed spraying.  
10-left wrist: Flexes to control nozzle direction and trigger pressure.  
11-right wrist: Supports grip or adjusts spray angle if using both hands.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight for stability when reaching forward.  
13-right hip: Balances posture to counter arm movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'spraying' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The spraying action is recognized by the forward rotation of the shoulder, controlled elbow extension, precise wrist flexion to direct the spray, and subtle hip adjustments for balance while the arm moves in a steady sweeping or targeted motion.
