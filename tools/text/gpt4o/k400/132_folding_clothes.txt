Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'folding clothes' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands grasp the garment's edges, bring them together, smooth out wrinkles, fold one side over the other, then repeat as needed to achieve the desired fold size.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'folding clothes': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly downward to observe the garment.  
Hand: Grasps and smooths fabric edges during folding.  
Arm: Moves inward and outward to adjust and fold the garment.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance while standing.  
Leg: Remains stable with slight adjustments for posture.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground, occasionally shifting for comfort.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'folding clothes' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly inward as arms bring garment edges together.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder movement for balanced folding.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust hand position while smoothing fabric.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to assist in folding and aligning edges.  
10-left wrist: Articulates to grip and adjust fabric tension.  
11-right wrist: Moves precisely to guide folds and flatten wrinkles.  
18-mid hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain stability while standing.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly to improve visibility and reach.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'folding clothes' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The folding clothes action is recognized by symmetrical inward shoulder rotation with coordinated elbow bends, precise wrist adjustments to smooth fabric, a slight forward thorax lean for visibility, and subtle hip shifts for balance while the hands guide and align folds.
