Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cheerleading' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'cheerleading' action by jumping with legs spread apart while simultaneously raising arms overhead in a V-shape, often accompanied by clapping or waving pom-poms for added flair.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cheerleading': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly or stays upright with a confident smile.  
Hand: Clenches pom-poms or forms sharp, open-palm motions.  
Arm: Extends dynamically in high V, T, or diagonal positions.  
Hip: Pops or shifts slightly to emphasize jumps or stance.  
Leg: Springs forcefully for jumps or stays straight in stunts.  
Foot: Lands firmly in toe-then-heel motion or stays on toes.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'cheerleading' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts and extends outward for sharp arm motions.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, driving dynamic arm positions.  
8-left elbow: Bends sharply during claps or extends fully in jumps.  
9-right elbow: Matches left elbow, ensuring symmetrical arm movements.  
10-left wrist: Flicks or waves pom-poms with quick, precise motions.  
11-right wrist: Syncs with left wrist for coordinated visual effects.  
12-left hip: Shifts slightly to stabilize or add flair during jumps.  
13-right hip: Balances with left hip, maintaining alignment in stunts.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'cheerleading' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Cheerleading is recognized by sharp, synchronized arm extensions (shoulders, elbows, wrists) forming high V or T shapes, paired with dynamic hip shifts and spring-loaded leg jumps, all executed with precise wrist flicks or pom-pom waves for added visual flair.
