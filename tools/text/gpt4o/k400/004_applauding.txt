Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'applauding' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands move toward each other from opposite sides, palms facing, and quickly clap together before separating again.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'applauding': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains mostly still or nods slightly in rhythm.  
Hand: Palms strike together repeatedly in a quick motion.  
Arm: Moves inward from the sides to bring hands together.  
Hip: Stays stable with minimal or no movement.  
Leg: Bears weight steadily without shifting.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground, maintaining balance.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'applauding' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly inward to bring arm forward.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates slightly inward to bring arm forward.  
8-left elbow: Bends to swing forearm and hand toward midline.  
9-right elbow: Bends to swing forearm and hand toward midline.  
10-left wrist: Flexes to position palm for clapping impact.  
11-right wrist: Flexes to position palm for clapping impact.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'applauding' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The applauding action is recognized by symmetrical inward shoulder rotation, synchronized elbow flexion bringing both forearms together, and rapid wrist flexion as the palms strike and rebound.
