Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'hammer throw' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The athlete rotates rapidly with the hammer, building momentum through a series of turns, then releases it at the optimal angle for maximum distance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'hammer throw': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns to track the hammer while maintaining balance during rotation.  
Hand: Grips the hammer handle firmly and releases at the peak of momentum.  
Arm: Extends outward, keeping the hammer at full radius during spins.  
Hip: Drives rotation forcefully, generating power for the throw.  
Leg: Pivots and pushes off the ground to maintain spin speed.  
Foot: Stays grounded initially, then lifts and repositions during turns.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'hammer throw' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward then forcefully forward to drive the hammer.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes and counterbalances the left shoulder's rotation.  
10-left wrist: Maintains firm grip, then whips the hammer outward at release.  
11-right wrist: Assists balance, often adjusting to control rotation speed.  
12-left hip: Initiates rotation, driving power through the lower body.  
13-right hip: Pivots sharply to sustain momentum during turns.  
18-mid hip: Anchors the rotational axis for smooth, controlled spins.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns upper body to transfer force efficiently to the hammer.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'hammer throw' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The hammer throw is recognized by a powerful rotational drive initiated by the hips, amplified through the shoulders' forceful swing, and finalized by a whip-like wrist release while the body maintains a tight, controlled spin around a stable central axis.
