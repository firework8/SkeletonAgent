Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing tennis' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The player shifts weight to the back foot, swings the racket forward to strike the ball, follows through with the arm, and quickly repositions to prepare for the next shot.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing tennis': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tracks the ball with focused gaze and slight turns.  
Hand: Grips the racket firmly and adjusts for shots.  
Arm: Swings forward with controlled power during strokes.  
Hip: Rotates to generate force and shift balance.  
Leg: Bends and pushes off for quick lateral movement.  
Foot: Pivots and steps to position for optimal reach.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing tennis' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward during backswing, then forward during swing.  
7-right shoulder: Leads the swing, driving power through the racket arm.  
8-left elbow: Bends slightly in backswing, extends during follow-through.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to prepare, then sharply extends to strike the ball.  
10-left wrist: Stabilizes grip, may adjust for spin or control.  
11-right wrist: Snaps forward on impact to add power and direction.  
12-left hip: Pivots backward to load power, then forward on swing.  
13-right hip: Drives rotation to transfer weight into the shot.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing tennis' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The tennis swing is recognized by the coordinated rotation of shoulders and hips driving forward, the snapping wrist at impact, and the dynamic weight shift from back leg to front leg during the stroke.
