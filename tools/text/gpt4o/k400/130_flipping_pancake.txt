Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'flipping pancake' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The wrist flicks upward while the forearm rotates, propelling the pancake into the air with a quick, controlled motion, then the pan shifts slightly to catch it as it descends.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'flipping pancake': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts forward to focus on the pan.  
Hand: Grips the handle firmly with fingers adjusting tension.  
Arm: Rotates at the elbow while the wrist flicks upward.  
Hip: Shifts slightly for balance but remains mostly still.  
Leg: Stays planted with knees slightly bent for stability.  
Foot: Flat on the ground, maintaining steady posture.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'flipping pancake' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing slight arm rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Anchors the flipping motion with controlled movement.  
8-left elbow: Bends slightly to adjust pan angle during flip.  
9-right elbow: Flexes sharply to generate upward flicking force.  
10-left wrist: Remains steady to maintain pan grip.  
11-right wrist: Snaps upward to launch the pancake.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly for balance and focus.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns torso for coordinated arm motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'flipping pancake' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The pancake flip is recognized by a quick upward wrist snap combined with a sharp elbow flexion to launch the pancake, while shoulders stabilize and the torso leans slightly forward to maintain balance during the controlled flick-and-catch motion.
