Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'writing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand grips a pen, fingers adjust pressure as the wrist pivots and arm moves smoothly across the surface, creating controlled strokes while the eyes track progress and the body maintains posture.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'writing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward, eyes tracking the writing surface.  
Hand: Grips the pen, fingers flexing to control pressure and movement.  
Arm: Moves smoothly across the surface, pivoting at the elbow and shoulder.  
Hip: Remains stable, supporting upper body posture.  
Leg: Stays grounded, knees bent slightly for balance.  
Foot: Rests flat or shifts subtly to adjust body alignment.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'writing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes arm movement, allows slight rotation for reach.  
7-right shoulder: Anchors arm, enables controlled horizontal motion.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to adjust hand height and angle.  
9-right elbow: Bends and extends for smooth pen strokes.  
10-left wrist: Fine-tunes grip and adjusts pen tilt.  
11-right wrist: Pivots for fluid letter formation.  
19-thorax: Maintains upright posture, supports arm coordination.  
20-mid shoulder: Balances bilateral arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'writing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Writing is recognized by the coordinated interplay of shoulder stabilization, elbow flexion for precision, subtle wrist pivots for stroke control, and thorax-supported posture, with asymmetrical arm engagement favoring the dominant hand's fluid movements.
