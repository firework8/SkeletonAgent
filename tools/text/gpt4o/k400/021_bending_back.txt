Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'bending back' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends backward by arching the spine, tilting the head and shoulders back, and extending the hips while engaging the back muscles for support.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'bending back': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts backward with the chin lifting upward.  
Hand: May extend slightly backward or remain relaxed.  
Arm: Often moves backward, possibly stretching or balancing.  
Hip: Pushes forward while the upper body arches back.  
Leg: Stays straight or slightly bent for stability.  
Foot: Remains planted, with weight shifting to the toes.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'bending back' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Moves backward and slightly downward as the upper body arches.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, shifting back and down for balance.  
12-left hip: Pushes forward to counterbalance the backward upper body tilt.  
13-right hip: Extends forward in sync with the left hip for stability.  
18-mid hip: Acts as the pivot point for the backward bend.  
19-thorax: Extends backward, creating the main arch of the spine.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors upper body movement, coordinating shoulder alignment.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'bending back' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The bending back action is characterized by shoulders shifting backward and downward, hips pushing forward as counterbalance, the mid hip serving as a pivot, and the thorax extending in a distinct spinal arch while the mid shoulder stabilizes the upper body alignment.
