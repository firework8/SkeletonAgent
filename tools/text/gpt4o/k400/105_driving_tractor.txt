Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'driving tractor' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body leans forward slightly, grips an imaginary steering wheel with both hands, and mimics turning it side to side while shifting weight and occasionally pressing an imaginary pedal with one foot.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'driving tractor': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward with eyes focused ahead.  
Hand: Grips an imaginary steering wheel, fingers flexed.  
Arm: Moves side to side as if turning a large wheel.  
Hip: Shifts subtly with steering movements for balance.  
Leg: Slightly bent, stabilizing posture while seated.  
Foot: Presses imaginary pedals, alternating between throttle and clutch.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'driving tractor' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward and back with steering movements.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, rotating with wheel turns.  
8-left elbow: Bends and extends as the hand steers side to side.  
9-right elbow: Moves in sync with left elbow during steering.  
10-left wrist: Twists subtly to adjust grip on the imaginary wheel.  
11-right wrist: Matches left wrist motion for coordinated steering.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight subtly when pressing imaginary pedals.  
13-right hip: Balances with left hip during pedal motions.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'driving tractor' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The "driving tractor" action is recognized by synchronized shoulder and elbow rotations steering an imaginary wide wheel, subtle wrist adjustments for grip, and slight hip shifts mirroring pedal presses while maintaining a forward-leaning posture.
