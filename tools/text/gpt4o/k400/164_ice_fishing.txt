Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'ice fishing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The angler crouches near a hole in the ice, grips the fishing rod, and flicks the wrist to jig the lure, then pulls up sharply when a fish bites.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'ice fishing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts forward to watch the fishing hole.  
Hand: Grips the rod and jigs the lure.  
Arm: Moves up and down to control the rod.  
Hip: Shifts slightly for balance while crouching.  
Leg: Bends to maintain a low stance.  
Foot: Presses into the ice for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'ice fishing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to control rod movement.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes while the arm jigs the rod.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust grip on auxiliary gear.  
9-right elbow: Flexes sharply to jerk the rod upward.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts grip on fishing line or bait.  
11-right wrist: Flicks to jig the lure with precision.  
18-mid hip: Shifts weight for balance on the ice.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns upper body for rod control.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'ice fishing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The ice fishing action is recognized by a crouched stance with subtle hip shifts for balance, a dominant arm sharply jerking the rod upward from the elbow while the wrist flicks the lure, and the shoulders stabilizing the motion as the off-hand adjusts auxiliary gear.
