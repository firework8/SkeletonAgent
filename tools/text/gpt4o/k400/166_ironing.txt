Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'ironing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'ironing' action by standing upright, gripping the iron handle with one hand, moving the iron back and forth over the fabric while the other hand steadies the garment, adjusting pressure and direction as needed.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'ironing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to watch the fabric.  
Hand: Grips the iron handle firmly, guiding its movement.  
Arm: Moves back and forth to slide the iron across fabric.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance while standing.  
Leg: Remains steady with slight adjustments for stability.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground, occasionally shifting stance.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'ironing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing arm movement for iron control.  
7-right shoulder: Anchors the ironing arm, enabling smooth forward-back motion.  
8-left elbow: Flexes slightly to adjust iron pressure on fabric.  
9-right elbow: Bends and extends to guide the iron's path.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts angle to smooth wrinkles or hold fabric taut.  
11-right wrist: Tilts the iron for precise edge or crease work.  
18-mid hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance during ironing.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates bilateral arm movements for stability.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'ironing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The ironing action is recognized by coordinated shoulder and elbow-driven arm movements guiding the iron in smooth back-and-forth motions, stabilized by subtle hip shifts and precise wrist adjustments to maintain fabric contact while standing.
