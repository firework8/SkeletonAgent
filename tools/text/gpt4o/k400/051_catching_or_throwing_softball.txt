Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'catching or throwing softball' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The body shifts weight to the back foot, rotates the torso forward, extends the arm to throw or reaches to catch the softball, then follows through with the arm and shifts weight to the front foot for balance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'catching or throwing softball': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns to track the ball or target during throw/catch.  
Hand: Opens to catch or grips the ball firmly to throw.  
Arm: Extends forward to catch or swings back then forward to throw.  
Hip: Rotates to generate power when throwing or braces for stability when catching.  
Leg: Steps forward to shift weight during throw or bends slightly to absorb impact when catching.  
Foot: Pivots on back foot when throwing or plants firmly for balance when catching.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'catching or throwing softball' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward during windup, then forward during throw or stabilizes during catch.  
7-right shoulder: Leads rotation during throw or adjusts position to align with the ball during catch.  
8-left elbow: Bends during windup, then extends forcefully during throw or flexes to absorb catch impact.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to prepare throw or extends to reach for catch, then follows through.  
10-left wrist: Snaps forward during throw release or adjusts angle to secure catch.  
11-right wrist: Controls ball release during throw or angles to cradle the ball during catch.  
12-left hip: Rotates to generate power during throw or braces to stabilize during catch.  
13-right hip: Pivots forward during throw or shifts weight to maintain balance during catch.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'catching or throwing softball' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by a coordinated sequence of shoulder rotation, elbow flexion-extension, wrist snap during throws or adjustment during catches, and forceful hip rotation driving weight transfer, all timed with precise hand-eye coordination to either propel or secure the ball.
