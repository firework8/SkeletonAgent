Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'golf putting' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The golfer stands with feet shoulder-width apart, bends slightly at the hips, holds the putter with a light grip, and smoothly swings the clubhead back and through in a pendulum motion, keeping the wrists firm and eyes focused on the ball, to roll it toward the target.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'golf putting': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains still with eyes fixed on the ball throughout the stroke.  
Hand: Maintains a light, steady grip with minimal wrist movement.  
Arm: Hangs relaxed, swinging the putter in a pendulum motion from the shoulders.  
Hip: Slightly bent forward, staying stable without rotation.  
Leg: Provides a balanced, quiet stance with slight knee flex.  
Foot: Stays planted flat, evenly distributing weight for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'golf putting' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stable with slight rotation during backswing and follow-through.  
7-right shoulder: Moves in sync with left shoulder, maintaining pendulum motion.  
10-left wrist: Firm and neutral, avoiding excessive hinge or break.  
11-right wrist: Mirrors left wrist, ensuring smooth clubface control.  
18-mid hip: Slightly bent forward, anchoring posture without sway.  
19-thorax: Rotates minimally, maintaining alignment with target line.  
20-mid shoulder: Acts as pivot point for pendulum-like arm swing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'golf putting' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The golf putting action is recognized by stable shoulders and mid-hip anchoring a slight forward bend while the arms swing like a pendulum with firm wrists, maintaining minimal torso rotation and quiet lower body for precise clubface control.
