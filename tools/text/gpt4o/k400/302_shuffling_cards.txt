Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'shuffling cards' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands grasp the deck, thumbs press down while fingers curl upward, then the hands move in opposite directions to interlace the cards, repeating the motion to mix them evenly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'shuffling cards': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward with eyes focused on the cards.  
Hand: Grips and splits the deck, fingers flexing to interlace cards.  
Arm: Moves inward and outward in short, controlled horizontal motions.  
Hip: Remains stable with minimal sway, supporting upper body balance.  
Leg: Static, bearing weight evenly with slight knee bend for steadiness.  
Foot: Flat on the ground, maintaining a firm base for stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'shuffling cards' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly rotates inward to stabilize arm movement.  
7-right shoulder: Moves forward slightly as the hand splits the deck.  
8-left elbow: Bends and extends in sync with wrist for card interlacing.  
9-right elbow: Flexes subtly to control the card-shuffling motion.  
10-left wrist: Twists and bends to guide cards into place.  
11-right wrist: Makes precise up-down flicks to mix the deck evenly.  
12-left hip: Remains fixed but subtly shifts weight for balance.  
13-right hip: Anchors posture with minimal sway during shuffling.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'shuffling cards' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The shuffling cards action is recognized by coordinated inward shoulder rotation, subtle elbow flexion, precise wrist flicks, and stable hip anchoring as the hands split and interlace the deck with controlled horizontal motions.
