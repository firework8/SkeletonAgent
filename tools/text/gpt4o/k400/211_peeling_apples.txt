Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'peeling apples' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand grips the apple, the other hand holds a peeler, then moves it in a downward or circular motion to remove the skin while rotating the apple gradually.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'peeling apples': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward to watch the peeling motion.  
Hand: Grips the peeler firmly while the other steadies the apple.  
Arm: Moves the peeler in short, controlled strokes or rotations.  
Hip: Remains stable with slight shifts for balance.  
Leg: Bears weight evenly with minimal movement.  
Foot: Stays planted flat on the ground for support.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'peeling apples' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing slight rotation for arm movement.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates forward slightly as the peeling arm extends.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust hand position for holding the apple steady.  
9-right elbow: Flexes and extends to control the peeling tool's motion.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts grip angle on the apple for even peeling.  
11-right wrist: Articulates precisely to guide the peeler's blade.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'peeling apples' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The peeling motion is characterized by asymmetrical arm coordination—one elbow flexes to stabilize the apple while the other extends in controlled strokes, with precise wrist adjustments guiding the peeler and slight shoulder rotations enabling smooth, repetitive peeling arcs.
