Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'using computer' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands reach for the keyboard or mouse, fingers type or click while eyes focus on the screen, and the body remains seated with occasional adjustments for comfort.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'using computer': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or turns to view the screen.  
Hand: Fingers type or grip the mouse with small, precise movements.  
Arm: Hovers or rests lightly to position hands near the keyboard or mouse.  
Hip: Remains stationary or shifts slightly for posture adjustments.  
Leg: Stays bent at the knee or extends for comfort while seated.  
Foot: Rests flat on the floor or moves occasionally to reposition.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'using computer' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly raised or relaxed to position arm for typing/mouse use.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left, adjusting for hand placement on keyboard or mouse.  
8-left elbow: Bent at ~90° to keep wrist near keyboard, with minor adjustments.  
9-right elbow: Similar to left, flexed for mouse control or right-hand typing.  
10-left wrist: Hovers or rests lightly, fingers extended for key presses.  
11-right wrist: Moves subtly for mouse clicks or stabilizes during typing.  
18-mid hip: Anchors posture, may tilt slightly forward when leaning toward screen.  
20-mid shoulder: Balances upper body, aligning with head and screen focus.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'using computer' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is characterized by slightly raised shoulders, bent elbows stabilizing near the keyboard, subtle wrist adjustments for typing or mouse control, and a forward-leaning mid-hip posture with the upper body aligned toward the screen.
