Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'presenting weather forecast' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body stands upright, gestures with one hand toward an imaginary map while the other holds a pointer, smoothly shifting gaze between the audience and the map, occasionally pointing to specific areas with precise arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'presenting weather forecast': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns smoothly to face different directions while maintaining eye contact.  
Hand: Gestures with open palm or points toward weather symbols or maps.  
Arm: Moves fluidly to extend gestures, occasionally sweeping across the display.  
Hip: Remains stable with slight shifts to balance weight during movement.  
Leg: Adjusts stance subtly for stability, rarely stepping far.  
Foot: Stays planted, occasionally pivoting to adjust body orientation.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'presenting weather forecast' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to extend arm for gesturing.  
7-right shoulder: Lifts and lowers to emphasize weather patterns.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust hand height while pointing.  
9-right elbow: Extends fully when sweeping across the display.  
10-left wrist: Tilts and flexes for precise pointing motions.  
11-right wrist: Moves fluidly to guide audience attention.  
19-thorax: Shifts subtly to align with arm movements.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors posture while allowing upper body rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'presenting weather forecast' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by smooth, controlled arm sweeps and precise wrist-guided pointing, anchored by stable shoulders and subtle upper-body rotations that emphasize weather patterns while maintaining a balanced posture.
