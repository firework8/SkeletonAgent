Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'massaging person's head' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands move in circular or kneading motions across the scalp, fingers applying gentle pressure while palms occasionally rest for support, alternating between slow strokes and targeted fingertip movements to relieve tension.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'massaging person's head': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains still or tilts slightly under the pressure of the massage.  
Hand: Fingers press and knead the scalp in circular or rhythmic motions.  
Arm: Moves smoothly to adjust hand position, bending at the elbow as needed.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance while standing or sitting.  
Leg: Adjusts stance for stability, knees slightly bent if standing.  
Foot: Anchors to the ground, toes relaxed for support.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'massaging person's head' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to position the arm for optimal reach.  
7-right shoulder: Adjusts angle to guide hand placement on the head.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to control pressure and movement range.  
9-right elbow: Bends dynamically for smooth, controlled massage strokes.  
10-left wrist: Tilts and rotates to direct finger pressure on the scalp.  
11-right wrist: Moves fluidly to transition between kneading and circular motions.  
19-thorax: Leans forward subtly to maintain balance and proximity.  
20-mid shoulder: Shifts slightly to coordinate bilateral arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'massaging person's head' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotations guiding fluid elbow bends and wrist tilts that create rhythmic scalp pressure, paired with subtle thoracic leans for balance while maintaining precise bilateral hand movements.
