Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'doing aerobics' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body moves rhythmically, performing dynamic steps, arm swings, and jumps in sync with music, engaging multiple muscle groups to elevate heart rate and improve cardiovascular fitness.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'doing aerobics': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Sways or bobs lightly to the rhythm. Hand: Opens and closes or swings in sync with steps. Arm: Pumps up and down or extends sideways. Hip: Swings or rotates with lower-body movements. Leg: Lifts, kicks, or steps briskly in patterns. Foot: Pivots, taps, or lands lightly on beats.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'doing aerobics' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts rhythmically with arm swings.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, driving upper-body motion.  
8-left elbow: Bends and extends during arm pumps or reaches.  
9-right elbow: Flexes and straightens in sync with left elbow.  
12-left hip: Swings side-to-side or rotates during steps.  
13-right hip: Moves oppositely to left hip, stabilizing lower body.  
14-left knee: Repeatedly bends and straightens for steps or jumps.  
15-right knee: Alternates with left knee, maintaining dynamic movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'doing aerobics' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Aerobics is recognized by synchronized rhythmic shoulder rotations, dynamic elbow pumps, opposing hip swings, and alternating knee bends driving continuous full-body motion.
