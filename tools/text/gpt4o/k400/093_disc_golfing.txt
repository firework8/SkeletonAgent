Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'disc golfing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The player stands sideways to the target, grips the disc, shifts weight to the back foot, then rotates hips and shoulders forward while transferring weight to the front foot, releasing the disc with a snap of the wrist for distance and accuracy.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'disc golfing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns to track the target during setup and follows the disc after release.  
Hand: Grips the disc firmly, then snaps wrist forward during release for spin.  
Arm: Swings back in a smooth arc, then accelerates forward to propel the disc.  
Hip: Rotates backward during wind-up, then drives forward to generate power.  
Leg: Shifts weight from back to front leg, stabilizing the throw.  
Foot: Pivots on the front foot during follow-through for balance and momentum.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'disc golfing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward during wind-up, then drives forward to power the throw.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes the upper body while left shoulder initiates rotation.  
8-left elbow: Extends during backswing, then sharply bends and releases for disc propulsion.  
10-left wrist: Snaps forward at release to generate spin and control disc trajectory.  
12-left hip: Rotates back during setup, then thrusts forward to transfer energy.  
13-right hip: Anchors posture and supports weight shift during the throwing motion.  
18-mid hip: Acts as the rotational axis for hip and torso movement.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates upper body alignment and arm synchronization.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'disc golfing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The disc golfing action is recognized by a coordinated weight shift from the hips driving rotation, a backward shoulder wind-up followed by a forward whip-like arm extension, and a sharp wrist snap at release, all pivoting around a stable mid-body axis for controlled disc propulsion.
