Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing accordion' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands grasp the accordion's sides, pushing and pulling to expand and compress the bellows while fingers press buttons or keys to produce sound, with arms moving rhythmically in and out.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing accordion': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts or nods with rhythm.  
Hand: Fingers press buttons or keys while palms steady the accordion.  
Arm: Pushes and pulls the bellows in and out.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to balance the instrument.  
Leg: Stays planted or adjusts stance for stability.  
Foot: Taps lightly or remains flat for support.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing accordion' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing arm movement for bellows control.  
7-right shoulder: Anchors the accordion while enabling push-pull motion.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to assist in expanding/compressing bellows.  
9-right elbow: Adjusts angle to guide the accordion's horizontal movement.  
10-left wrist: Maintains slight flexion for finger agility on buttons/keys.  
11-right wrist: Balances accordion weight while allowing precise finger action.  
12-left hip: Shifts subtly to counterbalance instrument weight.  
13-right hip: Supports posture during dynamic arm motions.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing accordion' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The accordion-playing motion is recognized by the rhythmic push-pull arm movement from the shoulders and elbows, stabilized by subtle hip shifts, while wrists maintain precise finger positioning on the keys and buttons.
