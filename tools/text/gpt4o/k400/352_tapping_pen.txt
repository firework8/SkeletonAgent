Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'tapping pen' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The fingers grip the pen, the thumb and index finger apply slight pressure, then the wrist flexes slightly to lower the pen tip onto the surface before quickly lifting it in a repetitive up-and-down motion.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'tapping pen': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains mostly still, possibly tilting slightly forward in focus.  
Hand: Grips the pen while fingers and thumb flex to tap the tip rhythmically.  
Arm: Hovers lightly with minimal movement, forearm stabilizing the hand's motion.  
Hip: Stays stationary, weight evenly distributed in a seated or standing position.  
Leg: Remains relaxed, muscles inactive unless shifting balance slightly.  
Foot: Planted flat or resting on toes, depending on seated or standing posture.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'tapping pen' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes arm, minimal rotation to support wrist movement.  
7-right shoulder: Slightly adjusts to maintain pen grip and control tapping rhythm.  
8-left elbow: Remains mostly static, slight flexion if supporting writing surface.  
9-right elbow: Hinges subtly to allow wrist up-down motion for tapping.  
10-left wrist: Stays relaxed but may assist in stabilizing paper or surface.  
11-right wrist: Flexes repeatedly to lift and lower pen tip during tapping.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly to maintain focus and arm positioning.  
20-mid shoulder: Balances upper body posture, aligning arms for smooth motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'tapping pen' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The tapping pen action is recognized by the rhythmic flexion of the wrist lifting and lowering the pen, stabilized by subtle elbow adjustments and minimal shoulder rotation, while the thorax leans slightly forward in focus.
