Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'filling eyebrows' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand moves a brush or pencil in short, upward strokes along the brow line to mimic hair growth, while the other hand may stretch the skin taut for precision.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'filling eyebrows': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or angles to focus on the mirror.  
Hand: Grips the brow tool and makes precise, feathery strokes.  
Arm: Adjusts position to stabilize the hand for controlled movements.  
Hip: Remains still or shifts slightly for balance while seated or standing.  
Leg: Stays planted to maintain posture, with minimal movement.  
Foot: Flat on the ground or lightly balanced if standing.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'filling eyebrows' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
2-left eye: Slightly narrowed for focus on the brow area.  
3-right eye: Mirrors left eye, ensuring symmetry in observation.  
10-left wrist: Controls fine brush/pencil strokes with precision.  
11-right wrist: Stabilizes or stretches skin if the dominant hand fills.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly to maintain close mirror proximity.  
20-mid shoulder: Adjusts posture to balance arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'filling eyebrows' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by subtle forward-leaning thorax posture, precise wrist movements for controlled strokes, slight eye narrowing for focus, and mid-shoulder adjustments to stabilize arm positioning during fine brow detailing.
