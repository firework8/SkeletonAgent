For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward slightly as the kicking leg swings.  
7-right shoulder: Moves forward to counterbalance the kicking motion.  
12-left hip: Drives forward to generate power for the kick.  
13-right hip: Stabilizes the body as the left leg swings.  
14-left knee: Flexes backward, then extends sharply to strike the ball.  
15-right knee: Slightly bends to maintain balance during the kick.

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing kickball' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The kickball action is recognized by a forceful forward swing of the kicking leg (hip rotation, knee extension, ankle stabilization) paired with counterbalancing arm and shoulder movements, while the supporting leg adjusts for balance with controlled hip and knee flexion.
