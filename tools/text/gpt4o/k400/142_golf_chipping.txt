Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'golf chipping' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The golfer stands with feet close together, shifts weight slightly to the lead foot, hinges the wrists to lift the club, then swings with a short, controlled motion, keeping the arms and shoulders in sync while striking the ball with a descending blow to loft it onto the green.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'golf chipping': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Stays steady with eyes fixed on the ball.  
Hand: Holds the club lightly, wrists hinge slightly on backswing.  
Arm: Moves in a short, controlled pendulum motion.  
Hip: Rotates minimally, staying mostly stable.  
Leg: Slightly flexed with weight favoring the lead side.  
Foot: Lead foot stays planted, back foot may lift slightly on follow-through.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'golf chipping' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly rotates back, then forward with controlled arm swing.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, stabilizing the backswing and downswing.  
8-left elbow: Hinges slightly, maintaining a firm but relaxed angle during motion.  
9-right elbow: Stays close to the body, guiding the club’s path.  
10-left wrist: Hinges upward on backswing, releases smoothly on downswing.  
11-right wrist: Firm but flexible, controlling clubface angle at impact.  
12-left hip: Minimal rotation, weight shifts slightly forward.  
13-right hip: Anchors stance, resisting excessive movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'golf chipping' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The golf chipping action is recognized by a compact, controlled swing with minimal hip rotation, slight shoulder and elbow hinge, precise wrist movement for loft, and stable lower body favoring the lead side.
