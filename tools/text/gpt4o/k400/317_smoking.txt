Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'smoking' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand lifts a cigarette to the mouth, inhales while holding it between fingers, then exhales smoke as the arm lowers.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'smoking': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or back as the person inhales or exhales smoke.  
Hand: Grips the cigarette, lifts it to the mouth, and flicks ashes if needed.  
Arm: Bends at the elbow to bring the cigarette to the mouth, then extends to lower it.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly when adjusting stance while smoking.  
Leg: Remains mostly still, though may bend slightly if leaning.  
Foot: Stays planted or taps lightly if impatient.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'smoking' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly lifts and rotates forward when raising the cigarette.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or adjusts posture as the dominant arm moves.  
8-left elbow: Bends to bring the cigarette toward the mouth, then extends.  
9-right elbow: May bend slightly if assisting or gesturing while smoking.  
10-left wrist: Flexes to position the cigarette, flicks ashes if needed.  
11-right wrist: Remains relaxed or adjusts balance if holding an object.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly during inhalation, relaxes back when exhaling.  
20-mid shoulder: Shifts subtly to coordinate arm and torso movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'smoking' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The smoking action is recognized by a forward shoulder lift and elbow bend bringing the hand to the mouth, followed by a slight thorax lean during inhalation, wrist adjustments for ash control, and a relaxed return motion.
