Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'swinging on something' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body grips an overhead object, bends the knees to lift the feet off the ground, and uses momentum to sway back and forth by alternately flexing and extending the arms and legs.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'swinging on something': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly back or forward to maintain balance.  
Hand: Grips the bar tightly with fingers curled around it.  
Arm: Alternately bends and straightens to generate swinging momentum.  
Hip: Shifts forward and backward in sync with the swing.  
Leg: Flexes at the knee to lift, then extends to push forward.  
Foot: Points slightly downward or adjusts for stability mid-swing.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'swinging on something' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward and backward to drive arm motion.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates forward and backward in sync with the left.  
8-left elbow: Bends during upward swing, extends during downward swing.  
9-right elbow: Mirrors left elbow's bending and extending.  
10-left wrist: Maintains firm grip while adjusting for balance.  
11-right wrist: Mirrors left wrist's grip and adjustments.  
12-left hip: Shifts forward and backward with swinging momentum.  
13-right hip: Mirrors left hip's shifting motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'swinging on something' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The swinging motion is recognized by alternating shoulder rotations driving bent-to-straight elbow movements while hips shift forward-backward in sync with the grip-maintaining wrists, creating a rhythmic pendulum-like body motion.
