Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'air drumming' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs 'air drumming' by rapidly moving the arms and hands in rhythmic motions, mimicking drumstick strikes on imaginary surfaces while often bobbing the head or torso to the beat.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'air drumming': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Nods or bobs rhythmically to the beat.  
Hand: Flicks wrists and fingers as if gripping drumsticks.  
Arm: Swings up and down or across to mimic drum strikes.  
Hip: Sways slightly or shifts weight side to side.  
Leg: Taps or bounces lightly in time with the rhythm.  
Foot: Taps toes or lifts heel to match the tempo.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'air drumming' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts slightly with arm swings.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates and lifts slightly with arm swings.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends rapidly for drumming motions.  
9-right elbow: Flexes and extends rapidly for drumming motions.  
10-left wrist: Flicks and twists to mimic drumstick strikes.  
11-right wrist: Flicks and twists to mimic drumstick strikes.  
12-left hip: Sways subtly to maintain balance and rhythm.  
13-right hip: Sways subtly to maintain balance and rhythm.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'air drumming' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Air drumming is recognized by rapid alternating elbow flexions driving wrist flicks in drumstick-like motions, paired with slight shoulder rotations and subtle hip sways for rhythmic stability.
