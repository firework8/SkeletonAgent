Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cutting pineapple' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body stands upright, grips a knife with one hand while steadying a pineapple with the other, then slices downward in a controlled motion, repeating as needed to cut the fruit into pieces.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cutting pineapple': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward to focus on the pineapple.  
Hand: Grips the knife firmly and slices downward with precision.  
Arm: Moves the knife in controlled, repetitive cutting motions.  
Hip: Remains stable to maintain balance while cutting.  
Leg: Slightly bent to support posture and stability.  
Foot: Flat on the ground to anchor the body.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'cutting pineapple' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing arm rotation for cutting.  
7-right shoulder: Anchors the knife arm, enabling controlled slicing.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to adjust hand position on the pineapple.  
9-right elbow: Bends and extends to drive the knife downward.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts grip and stabilizes the pineapple.  
11-right wrist: Guides the knife with precision during slicing.  
18-mid hip: Maintains balance and posture during the motion.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates bilateral arm movements for stability.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'cutting pineapple' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The cutting pineapple action is recognized by the dominant arm's elbow-driven slicing motion paired with the stabilizing shoulder and wrist control, while the non-dominant hand adjusts grip on the fruit and the torso remains balanced with minimal hip sway.
