Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'swimming breast stroke' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The swimmer extends arms forward, sweeps them outward and backward while pulling the body forward, simultaneously bending knees and kicking legs outward and backward in a frog-like motion, then glides with arms and legs extended before repeating the cycle.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'swimming breast stroke': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Lifts to inhale as arms pull, then lowers face-down to exhale.  
Hand: Starts palms together, sweeps outward then inward in a scooping motion.  
Arm: Extends forward, pulls outward and backward, then recovers forward.  
Hip: Rises slightly during the kick, then drops as legs extend.  
Leg: Bends knees toward hips, then kicks outward and backward.  
Foot: Flexes during kick, then points toes during glide.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'swimming breast stroke' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward during arm extension, then backward during pull.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, driving symmetrical arm movement.  
8-left elbow: Bends during arm pull, then straightens during recovery.  
9-right elbow: Matches left elbow, maintaining synchronized motion.  
12-left hip: Lifts slightly during kick, then lowers during glide.  
13-right hip: Moves in sync with left hip for balanced propulsion.  
14-left knee: Flexes sharply during frog kick, then extends.  
15-right knee: Coordinates with left knee for powerful leg thrust.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'swimming breast stroke' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The breaststroke is recognized by symmetrical shoulder-driven arm sweeps with synchronized elbow bends, paired with a frog-like hip lift and sharp knee flexions during the kick, creating a distinct push-glide rhythm.
