2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains steady with eyes fixed on the ball.  
Hand: Hangs relaxed or slightly raised for balance.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'kicking field goal' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while opposite arm swings for balance.  
7-right shoulder: Swings backward as kicking leg drives forward.  
12-left hip: Anchors weight for stability during kick.  
13-right hip: Rotates forward to generate power in the kick.  
14-left knee: Slightly bends to maintain balance and posture.  
15-right knee: Flexes back, then extends forcefully to strike the ball.  
16-left ankle: Remains firm to support standing leg.  
17-right ankle: Locks at impact, then follows through for power.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'kicking field goal' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by the powerful forward rotation of the kicking-side hip driving the leg's whip-like extension, synchronized with an opposing arm swing and anchored by the stable standing leg, culminating in a sharp ankle snap at ball contact.
