Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'arm wrestling' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The arm wrestling action begins with both participants gripping hands, elbows planted firmly on a surface, then each forcefully pushes or pulls the opponent's arm downward while resisting the opposing force to pin the hand.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'arm wrestling': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted forward slightly with focused gaze on the opponent.  
Hand: Grips opponent’s hand tightly, knuckles whitening from force.  
Arm: Engages muscles, bending or resisting to push or pull sideways.  
Hip: Remains stable, braced against the chair or surface for leverage.  
Leg: Feet planted firmly, legs tense to anchor the body’s stability.  
Foot: Presses into the ground, toes gripping for added resistance.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'arm wrestling' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing controlled rotation for arm leverage.  
7-right shoulder: Anchors the pushing/pulling motion, resisting opponent's force.  
8-left elbow: Acts as pivot, bending or locking to apply/receive pressure.  
9-right elbow: Functions as fulcrum, maintaining angle for optimal force transfer.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts grip angle to maximize torque against opponent.  
11-right wrist: Twists slightly to redirect force during the struggle.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'arm wrestling' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Arm wrestling is recognized by the opposing rotation of shoulders and elbows acting as pivots while wrists adjust grip angles under tension, with the torso and hips braced for stability against forceful lateral arm movements.
