Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'eating doughnuts' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand grasps a doughnut, lifts it to the mouth, the jaw opens and closes to bite, chewing occurs while the tongue moves the food, and the throat swallows the pieces.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'eating doughnuts': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts forward slightly to meet the doughnut.  
Hand: Grips the doughnut with fingers curled inward.  
Arm: Bends at the elbow to lift the doughnut upward.  
Hip: Remains stable with slight shifts for balance.  
Leg: Stays planted with minimal weight adjustments.  
Foot: Flat on the ground, providing steady support.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'eating doughnuts' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward as arm lifts the doughnut.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes while left arm performs the lifting motion.  
8-left elbow: Bends to bring the doughnut toward the mouth.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts angle to position the doughnut for biting.  
11-right wrist: May stabilize or assist in holding the doughnut.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly to aid in reaching the doughnut.  
20-mid shoulder: Shifts forward to align with the eating motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'eating doughnuts' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is characterized by a forward lean of the thorax, a bending left elbow lifting toward the mouth, subtle shoulder rotation for reach, and precise wrist adjustments to guide the doughnut into biting position.
