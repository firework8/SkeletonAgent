Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'roller skating' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body glides forward on roller skates by alternately pushing off with each foot, maintaining balance with arms slightly outstretched and knees bent for stability.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'roller skating': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly forward, eyes focused ahead for balance and direction.  
Hand: Relaxed, often slightly raised or out to the sides for stability.  
Arm: Alternately swings forward and backward in sync with leg movements.  
Hip: Shifts side to side to transfer weight during pushes and glides.  
Leg: Alternately bends and extends to push off and maintain momentum.  
Foot: Rolls smoothly on skates, toes angled outward during pushes.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'roller skating' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward and back with arm swing during pushes.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, counterbalancing leg movements.  
12-left hip: Shifts outward during right leg pushes for weight transfer.  
13-right hip: Shifts outward during left leg pushes for weight transfer.  
14-left knee: Flexes deeply during push-off, extends during glide.  
15-right knee: Flexes deeply during push-off, extends during glide.  
16-left ankle: Stabilizes foot roll, slight dorsiflexion during strides.  
17-right ankle: Stabilizes foot roll, slight dorsiflexion during strides.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'roller skating' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Roller skating is recognized by alternating deep knee bends during pushes, synchronized shoulder-arm swings counterbalancing hip shifts for weight transfer, and stabilized ankle rolls maintaining smooth gliding motion.
