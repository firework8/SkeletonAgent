Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'smoking hookah' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'smoking hookah': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to reach the hose, then leans back while exhaling.  
Hand: Grips the hose, lifts it to the mouth, and holds it steady during inhalation.  
Arm: Extends or bends to position the hose comfortably toward the mouth.  
Hip: Shifts weight slightly when adjusting posture for comfort.  
Leg: Stays relaxed, possibly crossed or stretched out for stability.  
Foot: Rests flat or slightly lifted, depending on seating position.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'smoking hookah' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly raises and rotates forward to guide the hose toward the mouth.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes posture, may tilt slightly back during inhalation.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust hose distance, flexes during drawing smoke.  
9-right elbow: Rests or bends lightly for balance, often resting on a surface.  
10-left wrist: Articulates to position the hose tip precisely at the lips.  
11-right wrist: Typically relaxed or lightly supporting the hose base.  
19-thorax: Expands slightly during inhalation, then relaxes while exhaling smoke.  
20-mid shoulder: Shifts subtly forward then back with the smoking rhythm.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'smoking hookah' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by a forward-leaning torso with bent elbows guiding the hose to the mouth, followed by a relaxed backward shift during exhalation, characterized by precise wrist adjustments and subtle shoulder rotations.
