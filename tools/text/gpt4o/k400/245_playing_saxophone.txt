Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing saxophone' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body holds the saxophone with both hands, fingers pressing keys while the mouth shapes around the mouthpiece, blowing air to produce sound as the torso remains upright and the head tilts slightly forward.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing saxophone': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward with jaw relaxed to position mouth on the mouthpiece.  
Hand: Fingers press and release keys rapidly to change notes.  
Arm: Elbows stay slightly bent to support the saxophone's weight.  
Hip: Remains stable to maintain balance while seated or standing.  
Leg: Bears body weight evenly, knees slightly bent if standing.  
Foot: Flat on the floor for stability, or tapping rhythm if seated.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing saxophone' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly raised and rotated forward to support saxophone weight.  
7-right shoulder: Lifted to position right arm for finger placement on keys.  
8-left elbow: Bent outward to stabilize saxophone body against torso.  
9-right elbow: Held at a moderate angle for wrist mobility during key presses.  
10-left wrist: Slightly flexed to cradle saxophone while maintaining balance.  
11-right wrist: Agile movements for precise finger placement on upper keys.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing saxophone' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The saxophone-playing motion is characterized by asymmetrical shoulder positioning with the right elbow angled outward for finger agility, left elbow stabilizing the instrument against the torso, and subtle wrist adjustments for key control while maintaining a forward-tilted upper body posture.
