Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) clear pike circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins from a handstand on the uneven bars, shifts shoulders slightly forward, then initiates a backward pike downswing with legs together, maintaining tension as the hips flex sharply to create a tight pike, then accelerates the circle backward by extending the hips and pushing the bars downward, transitioning into a controlled arch as the body rises, and finally snaps the legs together while pressing the shoulders open to regain a vertical handstand with full extension.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) clear pike circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tucked early, then lifts to neutral as shoulders open into the handstand, ensuring controlled rotation.  
Hand: Maintains firm grip, shifts weight slightly forward before downswing, then actively pushes bars downward during hip extension.  
Arm: Stays straight throughout, resisting collapse during pike, then drives forcefully backward to assist upward momentum.  
Hip: Sharply flexes into a tight pike (near 90°) on descent, then explosively extends to propel backward rotation.  
Leg: Straight and pressed together in pike, then whips upward in sync with hip extension for maximum lift.  
Foot: Points aggressively during pike, then snaps to a rigid line with legs in final handstand for clean finish.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) clear pike circle backward to handstand', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) clear pike circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates slight forward lean early, then drives aggressively backward during hip extension for upward momentum.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but with precise symmetry, ensuring even bar pressure during the backward circle.  
12-left hip: Flexes sharply (near 90°) in pike phase, then explosively extends to propel rotation into handstand.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip timing but must maintain perfect alignment to avoid twisting during the circle.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, maintaining tight pike angle before rapid extension for backward thrust.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes rotation, shifting slightly forward at start then opening fully in final handstand.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) clear pike circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a sharp pike snap during backward rotation, explosive hip extension timed with shoulder drive, and a rigid straight-body finish, contrasting with smoother swings or delayed hip actions in similar moves.
