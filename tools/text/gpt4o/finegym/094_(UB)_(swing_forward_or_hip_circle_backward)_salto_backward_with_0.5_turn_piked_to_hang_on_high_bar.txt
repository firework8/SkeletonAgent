Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) (swing forward or hip circle backward) salto backward with 0.5 turn piked to hang on high bar' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a powerful backward swing, generating momentum as the body extends fully, then initiates a backward salto with a 0.5 turn by sharply piking at the hips while rotating backward and sideways, transitioning into a controlled release of the pike to extend the body again as the hands regrasp the high bar in a hanging position, completing the rotation and maintaining fluidity throughout the movement.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) (swing forward or hip circle backward) salto backward with 0.5 turn piked to hang on high bar' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly back early to initiate rotation, then neutral during pike to maintain balance.  
Hand: Releases bar at peak of backward swing, regrasps with a half-turn twist for backward salto.  
Arm: Extends fully in backward swing, pulls sharply into pike, then re-extends for regrasp.  
Hip: Flexes aggressively mid-air at peak height to create piked shape, driving backward rotation.  
Leg: Straight in swing, snaps into pike with knees tight, then extends late for regrasp.  
Foot: Points toes throughout, aids in rotation by driving upward in pike, then aligns for landing.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) (swing forward or hip circle backward) salto backward with 0.5 turn piked to hang on high bar', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) (swing forward or hip circle backward) salto backward with 0.5 turn piked to hang on high bar' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with strong extension, then sharply retracts during pike to drive rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but delays slightly during 0.5 turn, aiding twist before regrasp.  
12-left hip: Flexes aggressively mid-swing, creating deep pike angle (<90°) to accelerate backward salto.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip flexion but rotates outward slightly to assist half-turn.  
18-mid hip: Rapidly shifts from extended to fully piked, acting as the rotation axis for the salto.  
20-mid shoulder: Maintains alignment early, then tilts laterally during twist to guide regrasp timing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) (swing forward or hip circle backward) salto backward with 0.5 turn piked to hang on high bar' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful backward swing transitioning into a sharply piked backward salto with a precise half-twist, where aggressive hip flexion drives rotation while asymmetrical shoulder timing ensures controlled regrasp after the turn.
