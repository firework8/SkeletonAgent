Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1 twist' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates a powerful forward run, accelerates into a round-off for horizontal momentum, then explosively rebounds backward off the hands into a backward takeoff, immediately driving the arms upward while the hips and shoulders rise sharply, initiating a backward rotation with a full 360-degree longitudinal twist (early in flight) as the body remains fully extended, maintaining tight alignment throughout the salto before spotting the landing and absorbing impact with slightly bent knees and controlled arm swing to stabilize.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1 twist' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Snaps sharply backward at takeoff to initiate backward rotation while tilting slightly sideways to cue the twist.  
Hand: Contacts the floor palms-down in the round-off, then whips upward at takeoff to generate lift and twist momentum.  
Arm: Drives forcefully upward and slightly across the body during takeoff to enhance both backward salto and axial twist.  
Hip: Extends fully backward at takeoff, maintaining a rigid line to prevent piking, unlike a tucked or piked salto.  
Leg: Remains straight and together throughout, driving explosively off the floor to maximize height and rotation.  
Foot: Pushes off toes in the round-off, then points aggressively in flight to maintain stretched body tension.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1 twist', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1 twist' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward asymmetrically at takeoff to initiate twist while staying aligned with the right shoulder.  
7-right shoulder: Slightly leads the left during twist, creating torque while maintaining full extension.  
12-left hip: Extends fully backward at takeoff, staying rigid to prevent pike and sustain backward rotation.  
13-right hip: Mirrors left hip but with subtle forward tilt to assist twist initiation.  
18-mid hip: Maintains straight alignment with thorax, ensuring a stretched body position throughout the salto.  
20-mid shoulder: Rotates axially during twist while keeping level to prevent lateral tilt.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1 twist' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is recognized by a powerful backward takeoff with full hip and shoulder extension, an early initiated axial twist while maintaining a rigid stretched posture, and asymmetrical arm drive to generate rotation without piking or bending.
