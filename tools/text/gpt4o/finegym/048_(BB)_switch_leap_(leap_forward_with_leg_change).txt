Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) switch leap (leap forward with leg change)' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a standing position on the balance beam, then swings one leg forward into a powerful leap, simultaneously switching legs mid-air with a sharp, upward drive of the opposite leg while the arms extend dynamically for balance, achieving maximum height and amplitude before landing smoothly on the beam with the new leading leg, maintaining control throughout the transition.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) switch leap (leap forward with leg change)' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Stays neutral and aligned with the spine, slightly lifted to maintain balance, contrasting with split leaps where the head may tilt for expression.  
Hand: Fingers stay extended and active, palms slightly turned inward for control, unlike relaxed hands in basic leaps.  
Arm: Sweeps upward dynamically in sync with the leap, reaching full extension at peak height, unlike passive arms in straight jumps.  
Hip: Rotates slightly forward during the leg switch, maintaining square alignment to distinguish from stag leaps with open hips.  
Leg: Front leg drives upward sharply before switching mid-air, showing a clear split before the change, unlike a hitch kick’s continuous motion.  
Foot: Leading foot points aggressively during takeoff, while the back foot snaps to a pointed position mid-switch, emphasizing precision over a simple split leap.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) switch leap (leap forward with leg change)', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) switch leap (leap forward with leg change)' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates upward drive early, extends dynamically to aid leg switch momentum.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but delays slightly to counterbalance the leading leg's thrust.  
12-left hip: Rotates forward sharply during takeoff, aligns square mid-flight for clean split.  
13-right hip: Drives backward at peak height to accentuate leg switch, then snaps forward for landing.  
14-left knee: Extends fully on takeoff, then bends slightly mid-air to facilitate leg change.  
15-right knee: Maintains tight extension until peak height, then whips forward to complete the switch.  
16-left ankle: Points aggressively at launch, stays dorsiflexed briefly before landing.  
17-right ankle: Snaps to pointed position mid-switch, emphasizing split precision.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) switch leap (leap forward with leg change)' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The switch leap is distinguished by a powerful forward leg drive with a sharp mid-air leg switch, synchronized shoulder thrust and hip rotation, creating a dynamic split before landing with precise ankle control and square hip alignment.
