Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) (swing backward) double salto forward tucked' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins by swinging backward on the uneven bars, generating momentum with a powerful hip extension and shoulder retraction, then initiates a rapid forward rotation by aggressively tucking the knees to the chest while pushing off the bars, completing two consecutive backward flips (saltos) in a tightly tucked position before releasing the bars mid-rotation and preparing for landing, with the entire movement characterized by precise timing, high amplitude, and seamless transitions between the swing, tuck, and rotational phases.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) (swing backward) double salto forward tucked' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward early in the backward swing, then sharply tucked to the chest to initiate forward rotation, maintaining neutral alignment during flight.  
Hand: Releases the bar late in the backward swing with a quick backward push, palms facing downward to maximize rotational force before tucking.  
Arm: Extends fully during backward swing, then pulls sharply inward and upward at the hips to accelerate the tucked rotation.  
Hip: Drives aggressively forward and upward at peak backward swing, creating the angular momentum needed for the double salto.  
Leg: Flexes rapidly at the knees, pulling tightly into the chest to maximize rotation speed, distinguishing it from open saltos.  
Foot: Points toes dynamically during swing, then snaps into the tuck position just before release, aiding rotational tightness.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) (swing backward) double salto forward tucked', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) (swing backward) double salto forward tucked' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with strong hyperextension, then drives upward sharply to propel rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but may delay slightly to control bar release timing.  
12-left hip: Thrusts forward aggressively at peak swing, bending beyond 90° to generate tuck momentum.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but with tighter flexion to enhance rotation speed.  
14-left knee: Snaps rapidly into chest during tuck, flexing past 120° for compact rotation.  
15-right knee: Synchronized with left but may tuck deeper to counterbalance bar push-off.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, tilting forward early to transition from swing to salto.  
20-mid shoulder: Maintains rigid alignment until release, then rounds forward to aid rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) (swing backward) double salto forward tucked' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by an explosive backward swing with hyperextended shoulders, a sharp forward hip thrust initiating rapid double rotation, and an ultra-tight knee tuck timed precisely with a late bar release for maximum aerial rotation speed.
