Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1.5 turn off' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast sprints forward, plants hands on the vaulting table in a round-off (rotating sideways with legs together), rebounds backward into a powerful flic-flac (back handspring with legs driving upward), transitions into a stretched salto backward (straight-body backflip) while simultaneously rotating 1.5 turns (540 degrees) around the vertical axis, and lands facing the opposite direction with controlled extension.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1.5 turn off' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tucks slightly forward during round-off, snaps backward sharply in flic-flac, then stays neutral with controlled rotation in salto to spot landing.  
Hand: Plants firmly in round-off with quick rebound, pushes explosively in flic-flac, then swings symmetrically upward in salto to initiate twist.  
Arm: Extends fully in round-off block, drives backward in flic-flac, then stretches overhead in salto to maintain straight-body rotation.  
Hip: Opens fully in round-off, hyperextends slightly in flic-flac, then remains rigidly extended in salto to prevent pike.  
Leg: Stays straight and together in round-off, whips powerfully in flic-flac, then remains fully stretched in salto to emphasize height.  
Foot: Points aggressively in round-off, snaps off the ground in flic-flac, then stays taut in salto to control twist and landing.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1.5 turn off', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1.5 turn off' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates early in round-off with strong backward drive, remains extended in flic-flac, then leads upward in salto twist.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but with slight delay in round-off for asymmetrical push, then aligns symmetrically in salto.  
12-left hip: Extends fully in round-off, hyperextends slightly in flic-flac, then locks straight in salto to prevent pike.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but with tighter control in flic-flac rebound to stabilize rotation.  
18-mid hip: Maintains rigid alignment throughout, preventing arch or tuck during salto twist.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors upper-body rotation, staying centered during 1.5 twist for controlled landing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1.5 turn off' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful round-off into a backward flic-flac with full hip extension, transitioning into a straight-bodied salto with a precise 1.5 twist while maintaining rigid shoulder and hip alignment for controlled rotation.
