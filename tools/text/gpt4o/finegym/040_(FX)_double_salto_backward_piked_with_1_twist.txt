Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) double salto backward piked with 1 twist' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the movement by explosively driving upward and backward from both feet, simultaneously lifting the arms overhead and leaning the torso backward to generate rotation, then tucking the knees toward the chest to transition into a piked position while initiating a rapid twist with the shoulders and hips, completing a full 360-degree twist mid-air before extending the body slightly to prepare for landing, all while maintaining a tight pike and controlled rotation throughout the double backward somersault.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) double salto backward piked with 1 twist' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Neutral early, then sharply tilts sideways to initiate twist while maintaining alignment with the spine.  
Hand: Starts open with palms facing backward, then closes slightly during twist for momentum control.  
Arm: Sweeps upward and backward in a wide arc, then pulls asymmetrically (one leading, one resisting) to drive the twist.  
Hip: Rapidly flexes into a tight pike (90° or sharper) while rotating laterally to assist the twist.  
Leg: Extends fully on takeoff, then snaps into pike with knees locked and toes pointed mid-flight.  
Foot: Pushes explosively off the floor with plantar flexion, then stays pointed and symmetrically aligned during twists.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) double salto backward piked with 1 twist', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) double salto backward piked with 1 twist' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward asymmetrically early to initiate backward rotation while leading the twist.  
7-right shoulder: Pulls inward slightly later than left, creating torque for the 360° twist.  
12-left hip: Flexes sharply (90°+) mid-flight to form pike while aiding lateral twist rotation.  
13-right hip: Maintains tight pike but delays rotation slightly to control twist timing.  
18-mid hip: Rapidly shifts laterally during twist while maintaining backward somersault momentum.  
19-thorax: Stays aligned with twist axis but tilts forward to deepen pike position mid-flight.  
20-mid shoulder: Rotates asymmetrically (left leads) to generate clean 1-twist without over-rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) double salto backward piked with 1 twist' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful backward takeoff into a tight pike, combined with a precisely timed asymmetrical shoulder-driven twist initiated mid-air, maintaining a sharp hip angle while rotating cleanly through one full twist before landing.
