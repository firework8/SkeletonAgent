Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) (swing forward) double salto backward stretched' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the movement by swinging forward on the uneven bars, generating momentum, then explosively pulls backward into a double backward salto, maintaining a fully stretched body position throughout the rotation, with the arms transitioning from a swing to a tight alignment near the torso during the first salto, while the legs remain extended and together, ensuring a controlled, high-amplitude rotation before preparing for the landing phase.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) (swing forward) double salto backward stretched' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tucked early to initiate backward rotation, then neutral to maintain straight body alignment.  
Hand: Releases the bar with a backward push, palms facing down, ensuring clean backward momentum.  
Arm: Swings forward then pulls sharply backward into a tight streamline, aiding rotation speed.  
Hip: Remains fully extended with no pike, distinguishing it from tucked or piked saltos.  
Leg: Stays straight and pressed together throughout, emphasizing height and control.  
Foot: Points aggressively from takeoff to landing, enhancing body line and minimizing drag.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) (swing forward) double salto backward stretched', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) (swing forward) double salto backward stretched' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives sharply backward with full extension, initiating backward rotation early.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in power for dominant-side control.  
12-left hip: Remains fully extended with no flexion, ensuring stretched body line throughout rotation.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but may delay extension slightly to counterbalance arm drive.  
18-mid hip: Maintains rigid alignment, preventing pike and distinguishing from tucked variations.  
19-thorax: Holds neutral position longer to stabilize rotation before landing preparation.  
20-mid shoulder: Leads upward thrust during release, critical for height and backward momentum.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) (swing forward) double salto backward stretched' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful backward drive from fully extended shoulders and hips during the swing release, maintaining a rigid stretched posture with no pike throughout two high, symmetrical backward rotations before landing.
