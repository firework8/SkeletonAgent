Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) transition flight from high bar to low bar' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the (UB) transition flight from the high bar by swinging backward with extended arms and a slight pike, then explosively releasing the bar at the peak of the backswing, rotating backward with a tight arch while traveling downward and forward, extending the arms toward the low bar, and regrasping it with straight arms and a controlled swing, completing the transition with a smooth connection into the next skill.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) transition flight from high bar to low bar' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: The head remains neutral or slightly lifted early, then tucks slightly backward during rotation to maintain alignment with the arched torso, distinguishing it from a piked transition.  
Hand: The hands release the high bar at peak backswing with a quick backward flick, then extend forward aggressively to regrasp the low bar, ensuring a long flight phase.  
Arm: The arms stay straight throughout release and flight, driving dynamically upward and forward in a wide circular motion, unlike bent-arm transitions.  
Hip: The hips maintain a tight backward arch during flight, creating a smooth rotational arc, contrasting with open-hip or piked transitions.  
Leg: The legs stay straight and pressed together, contributing to the arched shape, unlike transitions with split legs or bent knees.  
Foot: The feet point sharply and lead the downward trajectory, emphasizing the backward rotation and long, controlled flight path.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) transition flight from high bar to low bar', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) transition flight from high bar to low bar' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward rotation early, remains extended and stable during flight, driving upward momentum.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in force application for directional control.  
8-left elbow: Stays fully extended throughout flight, critical for maintaining straight-arm transition form.  
9-right elbow: Matches left elbow but may adjust subtly for regrasp timing on low bar.  
12-left hip: Arches backward sharply during release, creating rotational tension for flight distance.  
13-right hip: Synchronized with left hip but may lead slightly to control body alignment.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point for backward arch, timing determines rotation speed and flight trajectory.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors upper-body alignment, delays forward reach until peak rotation for optimal regrasp.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) transition flight from high bar to low bar' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This transition is distinguished by a powerful backward swing with fully extended arms, a deep arch in the hips during flight, and a long, controlled rotation before a precise straight-arm regrasp on the low bar, contrasting with piked or bent-arm variations.
