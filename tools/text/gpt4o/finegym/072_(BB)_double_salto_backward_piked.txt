Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) double salto backward piked' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the double salto backward piked by explosively swinging the arms upward and backward while pushing off the feet, driving the hips upward and backward into a tight backward rotation, then quickly transitioning into a piked position with the hips sharply flexed and legs extended as the body completes the first backward somersault, maintaining the pike while continuing the second rotation with controlled amplitude, and finally opening slightly to prepare for a smooth landing with the feet absorbing the impact while the arms stabilize the body.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) double salto backward piked' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Neutral or slightly tucked early to initiate backward rotation, then remains aligned with the spine to maintain piked posture.  
Hand: Starts palms-down during takeoff, swings sharply upward and backward to generate rotation, then stabilizes near knees in pike.  
Arm: Extends fully upward at takeoff, then pulls inward dynamically to tighten rotation, unlike the slower arm pull in a tucked salto.  
Hip: Explosively extends backward at takeoff, then sharply flexes to form a tight pike (near 90°) early in the first rotation.  
Leg: Straightens fully at takeoff, then lifts rapidly into pike with knees locked, creating a sharper angle than a tucked salto.  
Foot: Points aggressively during push-off, then stays extended in pike, aiding the streamlined shape for faster rotation than a layout.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) double salto backward piked', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) double salto backward piked' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward and backward explosively at takeoff, then pulls inward sharply to tighten rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in force for dominant-side rotation control.  
12-left hip: Extends fully at takeoff, then flexes abruptly to form a 90° pike early in first rotation.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but may flex marginally later for rotational balance.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, maintaining tight alignment during pike to maximize rotation speed.  
19-thorax: Stays rigidly aligned with hips in pike, unlike arched layouts or loose tucks.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates arm pull timing, ensuring symmetrical force for consistent double rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) double salto backward piked' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The double salto backward piked is distinguished by an explosive backward drive into a sharply flexed 90° hip pike early in rotation, with rigid thorax alignment and rapid symmetrical arm pull, creating tighter rotation than a layout or tuck.
