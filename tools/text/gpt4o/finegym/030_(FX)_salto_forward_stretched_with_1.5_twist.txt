Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1.5 twist' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the (FX) salto forward stretched with 1.5 twist by explosively driving forward off both feet, extending the body fully into a stretched position while simultaneously initiating a backward rotation (forward salto) and a rapid 1.5 twist (540°) with the arms and shoulders leading the motion, maintaining a tight, elongated form throughout the flip, and completing the twist just before landing with the feet absorbing the impact in a controlled, slightly bent-knee position.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1.5 twist' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly back early to spot the floor, then snaps forward to initiate the twist while maintaining alignment with the shoulders.  
Hand: Starts palms-down for push-off, then one hand pulls sharply across the chest to drive the 1.5 twist while the other remains extended for balance.  
Arm: Leading arm swings upward in salto initiation, then asymmetrically tucks inward to accelerate the twist while the other stays extended for control.  
Hip: Remains fully extended throughout the salto, with no pike, ensuring a stretched shape distinct from tucked or piked variations.  
Leg: Straight and locked from takeoff to landing, driving upward explosively and maintaining symmetry to avoid twisting deviations.  
Foot: Pushes off toes for maximum height, stays pointed mid-air, and lands slightly staggered to absorb impact while finishing the twist.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1.5 twist', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1.5 twist' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward explosively at takeoff, then asymmetrically rotates inward to initiate the 1.5 twist.  
7-right shoulder: Extends straight during salto but delays twist initiation slightly compared to the left side.  
12-left hip: Remains fully extended with no flexion, ensuring a stretched body line throughout rotation.  
13-right hip: Mirrors left hip but adjusts subtly mid-air to stabilize twist alignment.  
18-mid hip: Maintains rigid alignment with thorax to prevent piking, critical for the stretched position.  
19-thorax: Rotates as a single unit with shoulders during twist, avoiding lateral bends.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors the twist axis, staying centered while arms drive asymmetrical motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) salto forward stretched with 1.5 twist' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a fully stretched body throughout, an explosive forward salto with a delayed 1.5 twist driven by asymmetrical shoulder rotation, and rigid hip-thorax alignment preventing any pike or bend.
