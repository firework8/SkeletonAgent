Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 2.5 turn off' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a powerful run-up into a round-off, planting hands sideways while the legs swing over to rotate 90 degrees and rebound backward into a rapid flic-flac, pushing off the hands with a dynamic arch-to-hollow motion that generates backward momentum, then immediately initiates a stretched back salto with a forceful block off the feet, maintaining a tight, extended body position while executing 2.5 rapid backward rotations in the air before spotting the landing and sticking the dismount with controlled precision.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 2.5 turn off' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Rapidly tucks then lifts sharply backward during the round-off to initiate rotation, stays neutral in the flic-flac, then whips back forcefully in the salto to drive the 2.5 turns.  
Hand: Plants sideways in the round-off with fingers angled outward, pushes explosively backward in the flic-flac with straight arms, then swings upward in the salto for momentum.  
Arm: Swings dynamically upward in the round-off, extends fully backward in the flic-flac, then pulls tightly into the chest during the salto to accelerate rotation.  
Hip: Snaps from open to closed in the round-off, hyperextends in the flic-flac for rebound, then remains fully extended and rigid in the salto for a stretched position.  
Leg: Drives powerfully into the round-off with a split-step, whips rapidly in the flic-flac for backward propulsion, then stays straight and together in the salto for maximum rotation speed.  
Foot: Pushes off toes aggressively in the round-off, rebounds sharply from the floor in the flic-flac, then points tightly in the salto to maintain aerodynamic form.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 2.5 turn off', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 2.5 turn off' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates early upward swing in round-off, rotates sharply backward in flic-flac, then locks into rigid alignment during salto.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but with slight delay in round-off, drives explosive backward push in flic-flac.  
12-left hip: Hyperextends in flic-flac rebound, stays fully extended and rotated inward during salto.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but with stronger propulsion in flic-flac, maintains symmetry in salto.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, snaps from open to closed in round-off, drives backward thrust in flic-flac.  
19-thorax: Remains rigidly aligned in salto, resists flexion to maintain stretched position.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors rotation, stays centered during round-off, tilts slightly backward in salto initiation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 2.5 turn off' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a rapid round-off into a powerful backward flic-flac with hyperextended hips, immediately transitioning into a tightly stretched salto with 2.5 backward rotations, maintaining rigid thoracic alignment and symmetrical shoulder-hip coordination throughout.
