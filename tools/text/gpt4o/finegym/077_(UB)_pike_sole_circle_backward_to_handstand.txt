Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) pike sole circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a handstand on the uneven bars, then smoothly lowers the legs forward into a pike position while maintaining shoulder extension, initiates a backward circle by driving the hips upward and backward as the legs pass under the bar, shifts the shoulders forward to maintain momentum, and finally extends the hips and legs upward to return to a controlled handstand, completing the movement with precise timing and fluid transitions between phases.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) pike sole circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral or slightly lifted, tracking the motion to assist balance, distinct from tucked circles where it tucks forward.  
Hand: Maintains a firm grip with slight wrist adjustments to control backward rotation, differing from free hip circles where wrists shift more.  
Arm: Stays straight but dynamically adjusts shoulder angle to control the pike-to-extension transition, unlike in stalder circles where arms bend.  
Hip: Initiates the backward drive with a sharp upward thrust in pike before extending late, unlike clear hip circles where hips stay closer to the bar.  
Leg: Starts in a tight pike, then swings backward in a controlled straight path, differing from toe-on circles where legs stay split.  
Foot: Points aggressively throughout, with soles brushing the bar in pike phase, unlike in inbar skills where feet hook the bar.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) pike sole circle backward to handstand', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) pike sole circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward rotation with controlled depression, staying aligned to avoid excessive lean.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in timing during pike phase.  
12-left hip: Drives sharply upward in early pike, then extends late with controlled backward momentum.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but may delay extension slightly to maintain balance.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, thrusting upward in pike before fully extending into handstand.  
19-thorax: Maintains slight forward lean early, then straightens aggressively in final extension.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes rotation, adjusting angle dynamically to control backward swing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) pike sole circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a sharp pike-driven backward rotation with hips thrusting upward early, followed by a late extension into handstand, requiring strict shoulder alignment and aggressive foot-pointing throughout, unlike free hip or stalder circles where momentum and body angles differ.
