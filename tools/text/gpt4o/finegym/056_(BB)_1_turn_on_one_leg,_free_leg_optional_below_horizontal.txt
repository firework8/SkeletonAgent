Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) 1 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins upright on one leg with the free leg slightly lifted, then initiates a controlled turn by rotating the supporting leg’s hip and pivoting on the ball of the foot while the free leg remains below horizontal, either held straight or bent, as the torso stays aligned over the base of support, completing a full 360-degree rotation with the arms aiding balance, and finishes upright with the free leg returning to the starting position or transitioning smoothly into the next movement.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) 1 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Maintains a neutral or slightly lifted position, tracking forward to aid balance, distinguishing it from turns where the head leads rotation.  
Hand: Starts close to the body, may open slightly during rotation for balance, unlike turns with dramatic arm swings.  
Arm: Stays in a controlled, slightly rounded position or extends softly to the side, aiding rotation without excessive flair.  
Hip: Rotates steadily around the supporting leg’s axis, avoiding excessive tilt, unlike turns with pronounced hip shifts.  
Leg: Free leg remains straight or slightly bent below horizontal, distinguishing it from turns where the leg lifts higher.  
Foot: Supporting foot pivots smoothly on the ball, while the free foot stays pointed, contrasting with turns involving foot flexing or abrupt stops.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) 1 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) 1 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly lowered and stabilized to counterbalance the free leg, rotating minimally during the turn.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may lift slightly higher if the free leg is on the same side.  
12-left hip: Drives rotation with controlled alignment, staying level to avoid excessive tilt.  
13-right hip: If supporting leg, remains fixed in slight external rotation; if free leg, stays below horizontal.  
14-left knee: Free leg’s knee remains straight or softly bent, never exceeding 30° flexion.  
15-right knee: Supporting leg’s knee stays extended but not locked, with micro-adjustments for balance.  
18-mid hip: Acts as the pivot point, rotating smoothly without lateral deviation.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns vertically over mid-hip, preventing forward/backward lean during rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) 1 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This turn is distinguished by a controlled single-leg pivot with the free leg held straight or slightly bent below horizontal, minimal upper-body sway, and precise hip-shoulder alignment throughout the smooth 360-degree rotation.
