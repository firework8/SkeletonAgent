Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) 2 turn with free leg held upward in 180 split position throughout turn' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the (FX) 2 turn by standing upright on one leg, swiftly rotating 360 degrees in a single direction while dynamically lifting the free leg into a 180-degree split position, maintaining the split with controlled amplitude and precise alignment throughout both rotations, ensuring the supporting leg remains firmly planted and the torso stays upright as the arms transition smoothly from an initial preparatory position into a steady, balanced finish.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) 2 turn with free leg held upward in 180 split position throughout turn' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Maintains a neutral, upright position with gaze fixed forward to aid balance, distinguishing it from turns with tilted or turned heads.  
Hand: Starts slightly open with fingers extended, then stabilizes in a controlled position, often near the waist, unlike flaring arms in less precise turns.  
Arm: Remains in a steady, slightly rounded position close to the body, aiding rotation without excessive swing, unlike wider arm motions in basic turns.  
Hip: Stays square and level throughout rotation, ensuring the 180° split is symmetrical, unlike turns where hips open or tilt.  
Leg: Free leg lifts swiftly to a fully extended 180° split and remains static, unlike turns where the leg lowers or wobbles mid-rotation.  
Foot: Supporting foot pivots smoothly on the ball with minimal heel contact, maintaining continuous rotation, unlike steps or hops in simpler turns.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) 2 turn with free leg held upward in 180 split position throughout turn', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) 2 turn with free leg held upward in 180 split position throughout turn' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes slightly lowered to counterbalance the free leg’s upward split, maintaining alignment throughout rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may adjust subtly to aid arm positioning for rotational control.  
12-left hip: Drives upward as the free leg lifts into the 180° split, remaining square to prevent tilt.  
13-right hip: Anchors the supporting leg, staying level and stable while enabling smooth pivoting.  
14-left knee: Fully extends early to lock the free leg in the split, maintaining rigidity mid-turn.  
15-right knee: Slightly bent at initiation for momentum, then straightens to stabilize the supporting leg.  
18-mid hip: Keeps centered over the pivot foot, ensuring no lateral shift during rotation.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns vertically with mid-hip to prevent upper-body lean, crucial for balance.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) 2 turn with free leg held upward in 180 split position throughout turn' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is recognized by its continuous 360° rotation on one leg while maintaining a rigid 180° split with the free leg, requiring precise hip-square alignment, upright torso stability, and controlled shoulder counterbalance to distinguish it from turns with lower leg lifts or unstable posture.
