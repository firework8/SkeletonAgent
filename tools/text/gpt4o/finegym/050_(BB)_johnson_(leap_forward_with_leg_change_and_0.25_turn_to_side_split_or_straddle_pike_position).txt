Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) johnson (leap forward with leg change and 0.25 turn to side split or straddle pike position)' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins by leaping forward with one leg extended and the other bent, simultaneously executing a 0.25 turn mid-air while switching legs, then lands in a side split or straddle pike position with the legs wide apart and the torso bent forward, maintaining control and precision throughout the dynamic transition.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) johnson (leap forward with leg change and 0.25 turn to side split or straddle pike position)' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Stays neutral or slightly lifted, tracking forward to maintain balance during the 0.25 turn and leg switch.  
Hand: Arms extend sideways or slightly upward, palms facing down, aiding rotation and stability during the leap.  
Arm: Sweeps smoothly in sync with the turn, maintaining symmetry to control the 0.25 rotation.  
Hip: Rotates 90° during the turn while staying level, enabling the leg change and split position.  
Leg: Front leg lifts forward in the leap, then switches mid-air with the back leg to achieve the side split.  
Foot: Front foot points sharply during takeoff, while the back foot drives upward to propel the leg switch.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) johnson (leap forward with leg change and 0.25 turn to side split or straddle pike position)', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) johnson (leap forward with leg change and 0.25 turn to side split or straddle pike position)' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Extends sideways at takeoff, slightly rotates backward during the 0.25 turn.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but leads rotation, aiding the turn direction.  
12-left hip: Drives upward in leap, then opens sharply for side split.  
13-right hip: Initiates forward thrust, switches mid-air to align with left hip in split.  
14-left knee: Straightens fully in leap, bends slightly before split landing.  
15-right knee: Flexes at takeoff, snaps straight during leg switch.  
18-mid hip: Rotates 90° precisely during turn, stays level for split stability.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors rotation, delays slight tilt to counterbalance hip motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) johnson (leap forward with leg change and 0.25 turn to side split or straddle pike position)' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
A forward leap with a precise 0.25 turn and mid-air leg switch into a wide side split or straddle pike distinguishes this element, requiring sharp hip rotation, symmetrical shoulder alignment, and controlled knee extension timing.
