Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) 1 turn with heel of free leg forward at horizontal throughout turn' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the '(FX) 1 turn with heel of free leg forward at horizontal throughout turn' by standing upright, then lifting the free leg straight forward to horizontal with the heel leading, maintaining this position while rotating 360 degrees on the support leg with controlled balance, keeping the torso upright and arms typically extended for stability, and completing the turn with the free leg still held at horizontal before lowering it smoothly to finish.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) 1 turn with heel of free leg forward at horizontal throughout turn' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright and neutral, tracking forward to maintain balance, distinguishing it from turns with head tilts.  
Hand: Typically held in a controlled position (e.g., open or slightly curved), aiding stability without excessive swing.  
Arm: Extends outward or slightly upward for balance, maintaining symmetry without swinging to prevent momentum shifts.  
Hip: Stays square and level throughout rotation, preventing tilt that would disrupt the heel-forward horizontal line.  
Leg: Free leg lifts straight forward to horizontal with heel leading, held rigidly to contrast bent-knee turns.  
Foot: Support foot pivots smoothly on the ball while free foot maintains a pointed toe with heel forward, emphasizing precision.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) 1 turn with heel of free leg forward at horizontal throughout turn', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) 1 turn with heel of free leg forward at horizontal throughout turn' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Remains level and stable, rotating with torso to avoid tilting during turn.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, maintaining symmetry to prevent imbalance from free leg lift.  
12-left hip: Anchors rotation, staying square with minimal tilt as free leg lifts forward.  
13-right hip: Extends slightly to lift right leg to horizontal, maintaining rigid alignment throughout turn.  
14-left knee: Support leg remains straight with controlled micro-adjustments for balance during pivot.  
15-right knee: Free leg locks straight at horizontal, heel leading with no bend to distinguish from bent-leg turns.  
18-mid hip: Acts as rotation axis, staying centered to ensure clean 360° turn without wobble.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns over mid hip, preventing forward/backward lean for controlled rotational stability.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) 1 turn with heel of free leg forward at horizontal throughout turn' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is recognized by the free leg held rigidly straight at horizontal with heel leading while rotating smoothly on the support leg, maintaining upright posture with squared hips and shoulders for a controlled 360° turn without tilt or bend.
