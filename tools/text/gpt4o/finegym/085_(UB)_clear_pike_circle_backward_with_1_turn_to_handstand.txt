Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) clear pike circle backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a handstand on the uneven bars, then swings backward with a slight pike at the hips, maintaining straight arms as the body descends; as the swing reaches its lowest point, the gymnast aggressively extends the hips and shoulders while initiating a backward rotation, pulling the legs into a tight pike to accelerate the upward momentum; during the ascent, the body transitions from pike to a slight arch as the gymnast completes a 360-degree turn around the bar, using precise shoulder and wrist action to control the rotation, and finally extends fully into a handstand, achieving a controlled finish with the body aligned vertically and arms straight.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) clear pike circle backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: The head remains neutral or slightly tilted back early in the swing, then tucks slightly during the pike to aid rotation before lifting sharply in the turn to spot the handstand.  
Hand: The hands maintain a firm grip on the bar, with wrists actively shifting during the turn to control rotation, unlike in a simple clear hip where wrist action is minimal.  
Arm: The arms stay straight and rigid throughout, driving upward in the extension phase to generate lift, contrasting with bent-arm variations like stalder circles.  
Hip: The hips sharply pike (~90°) at the swing’s low point, then explosively extend to propel rotation, differing from a clear hip circle’s smoother hip motion.  
Leg: The legs remain straight and pressed together in the pike, then whip upward in sync with hip extension, creating the distinctive "pop" for the turn.  
Foot: The feet point aggressively during the pike and turn, with a quick snap to a stretched position in the handstand, emphasizing amplitude.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) clear pike circle backward with 1 turn to handstand', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) clear pike circle backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with slight depression, then aggressively extends upward during hip pop to drive rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show subtle asymmetry in wrist shift timing during the turn.  
12-left hip: Sharp pike (~90°) at swing low point, then explosively extends beyond 180° to propel backward rotation.  
13-right hip: Synchronized with left hip but may delay extension slightly to control turn precision.  
18-mid hip: Maintains midline alignment early, then sharply flexes in pike before hyperextending to maximize lift.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors rotation, staying stacked over wrists longer than in basic clear hips to stabilize the turn.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) clear pike circle backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a sharp pike at the hip followed by explosive extension driving a backward rotation, with rigid arms and precise wrist control enabling a full turn before locking into a vertical handstand, unlike simpler clear hip circles.
