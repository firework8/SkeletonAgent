Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) salto backward stretched with 2.5 twist' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates a powerful backward takeoff with legs driving upward and arms swinging back, transitioning into a rapid backward rotation with the body fully stretched, then dynamically initiates a 2.5 twist by sharply pulling one arm to the hip and the other across the chest while maintaining amplitude, completing the twists before transitioning into a controlled landing with feet absorbing impact and arms stabilizing.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) salto backward stretched with 2.5 twist' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted back at takeoff to initiate backward rotation, then remains neutral during twist to maintain axis control.  
Hand: Lead hand pulls sharply to hip to start twist, while trailing hand crosses chest for torque, both symmetrical in timing.  
Arm: Swing backward forcefully at takeoff, then asymmetrically tuck inward during twist—one arm tight to hip, the other driving rotation.  
Hip: Fully extended throughout salto, resisting pike to maintain stretched position, twisting initiated by shoulder-hip separation.  
Leg: Drive upward explosively at takeoff, staying straight and together during rotation, slight inward press to stabilize twist.  
Foot: Pointed toes during flight, absorb landing with slight flexion, staggered foot positioning if twist is slightly under-rotated.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) salto backward stretched with 2.5 twist', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) salto backward stretched with 2.5 twist' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward explosively at takeoff, then asymmetrically tucks inward to initiate twist.  
7-right shoulder: Swings back forcefully, then crosses chest sharply to generate rotational torque.  
12-left hip: Fully extended throughout salto, resists flexion to maintain stretched form.  
13-right hip: Twists slightly ahead of left hip to enhance rotation speed.  
18-mid hip: Stays aligned with thorax early, then rotates rapidly during the 2.5 twist.  
19-thorax: Remains rigidly straight, twisting only after full backward rotation initiates.  
20-mid shoulder: Leads backward rotation before asymmetrically splitting arm motions for twist.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) salto backward stretched with 2.5 twist' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful backward takeoff into a fully stretched salto followed by a late, asymmetrical arm-driven 2.5 twist while maintaining rigid hip and thoracic alignment.
