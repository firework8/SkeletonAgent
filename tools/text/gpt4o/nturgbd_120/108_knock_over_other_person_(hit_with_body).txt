Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'knock over other person (hit with body)' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body initiates the "knock over another person" action by accelerating forward, driving force through the legs and core, then making forceful contact with the opponent using the shoulder, hip, or torso, transferring momentum to destabilize and topple them.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'knock over other person (hit with body)': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tucks slightly forward for protection or leans into impact.  
Hand: May brace or push for added force, or stay close to the body.  
Arm: Extends or tightens to reinforce the pushing motion or absorb shock.  
Hip: Drives forward or twists to generate power in the collision.  
Leg: Steps forcefully or widens stance to stabilize and propel the body.  
Foot: Plants firmly or steps forward to transfer momentum into the target.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'knock over other person (hit with body)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Rotates and drives forward to generate power.  
2-middle of the spine: Stabilizes and transfers force upward.  
3-neck: Aligns with spine to support head movement.  
4-head: Tilts slightly forward for balance and protection.  
5-left shoulder: Extends forward to lead the impact.  
13-left hip: Thrusts forward to maximize collision force.  
17-right hip: Anchors and stabilizes the body.  
21-spine: Maintains rigidity to channel momentum forward.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'knock over other person (hit with body)' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by forceful forward rotation of the base and middle spine, a forward-driven shoulder and hip, stabilized neck and head alignment, and rigid spine momentum transfer for impact.
