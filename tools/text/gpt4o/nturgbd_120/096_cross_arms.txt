Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cross arms' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
When performing the 'cross arms' action, the arms move horizontally toward the midline of the body, with one forearm crossing over the other at the elbows or wrists, typically in front of the torso.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cross arms': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Typically remains upright or tilts slightly.  
Hand: Fingers may relax or lightly grip the opposite arm.  
Arm: Forearms cross horizontally at the elbows or wrists.  
Hip: Generally stays neutral or shifts weight slightly.  
Leg: Usually remains straight or slightly bent.  
Foot: Stays planted in place, weight evenly distributed.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'cross arms' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
5-left shoulder: Rotates slightly inward as arm crosses.  
6-left elbow: Bends to bring forearm across the body.  
7-left wrist: Aligns horizontally as hand crosses over.  
9-right shoulder: Rotates inward to facilitate arm crossing.  
10-right elbow: Bends to position forearm under the left arm.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts angle to allow smooth crossing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'cross arms' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'cross arms' action is recognized by the inward rotation of shoulders, bending of elbows to bring forearms horizontally across the torso, and slight wrist adjustments as one arm crosses over the other.
