Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'finger-guessing game (playing rock-paper-scissors)' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'finger-guessing game' by swiftly forming either a fist (rock), an open palm (paper), or a "V" with the index and middle fingers (scissors) in a synchronized, rhythmic motion from the elbow and wrist, typically accompanied by a downward arm swing for emphasis.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'finger-guessing game (playing rock-paper-scissors)': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains mostly steady with slight forward or backward tilts for emphasis.  
Hand: Forms rock (fist), paper (flat palm), or scissors (extended index and middle fingers).

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'finger-guessing game (playing rock-paper-scissors)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly tilts forward or backward with arm motion.  
4-head: Nods subtly in sync with the game's rhythm.  
7-left wrist: Flicks downward to form rock, paper, or scissors.  
8-left hand: Shapes into fist (rock), flat palm (paper), or scissors (V-fingers).  
11-right wrist: Flicks downward to form rock, paper, or scissors.  
12-right hand: Shapes into fist (rock), flat palm (paper), or scissors (V-fingers).  
22-tip of the left hand: Extends or curls for precise gesture formation.  
24-tip of the right hand: Extends or curls for precise gesture formation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'finger-guessing game (playing rock-paper-scissors)' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features recognizing the finger-guessing game are rapid downward wrist flicks with alternating hand shapes (fist, flat palm, or V-fingers), subtle head nods, and slight neck tilts synchronized with the rhythmic arm motion.
