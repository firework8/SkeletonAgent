Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'touch back (backache)' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'touch back (backache)' action by bending at the waist, reaching the hands backward to touch the lower back or heels while keeping the legs straight or slightly bent.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'touch back (backache)': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or remains neutral.  
Hand: Reaches backward to touch the lower back or heels.  
Arm: Extends backward with elbow bent or straight.  
Hip: Hinges forward to allow torso flexion.  
Leg: Stays straight or slightly bent at the knee.  
Foot: Remains flat on the ground, maintaining balance.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'touch back (backache)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Hinges forward to enable torso flexion.  
2-middle of the spine: Bends to facilitate upper body movement.  
7-left wrist: Extends or flexes to position the left hand.  
8-left hand: Reaches backward to touch the lower back or heel.  
11-right wrist: Extends or flexes to position the right hand.  
12-right hand: Reaches backward to touch the lower back or heel.  
13-left hip: Flexes to allow forward torso lean.  
17-right hip: Flexes to allow forward torso lean.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'touch back (backache)' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'touch back (backache)' action is recognized by forward torso flexion with spine bending, hip flexion enabling the lean, and hands reaching backward to touch the lower back or heels while wrists adjust positioning.
