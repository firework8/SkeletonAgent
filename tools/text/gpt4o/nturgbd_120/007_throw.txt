Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'throw' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'throw' action by sequentially engaging the legs, hips, torso, shoulders, arm, and wrist to generate and transfer kinetic energy, propelling an object forward with speed and accuracy.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'throw': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly toward the target for focus.  
Hand: Grips and releases the object with precise timing.  
Arm: Swings forward with force to propel the object.  
Hip: Rotates forward to generate power from the torso.  
Leg: Steps forward or braces to stabilize the body.  
Foot: Pivots or plants firmly to support the throw.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'throw' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Rotates slightly to align with throwing direction.  
4-head: Focuses forward toward the target.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes as right side throws.  
6-left elbow: Remains bent or relaxed for balance.  
7-left wrist: Minimal movement, mostly passive.  
8-left hand: Slightly open or relaxed.  
9-right shoulder: Rotates forward to generate throwing power.  
10-right elbow: Extends forcefully to propel the object.  
11-right wrist: Flicks forward for release and accuracy.  
12-right hand: Opens to release the object at peak motion.  
13-left hip: Shifts weight backward for counterbalance.  
17-right hip: Rotates forward to drive throwing force.  
21-spine: Twists to transfer energy from lower to upper body.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'throw' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'throw' action is recognized by the forceful forward rotation of the right shoulder and hip, extension of the right elbow, flick of the right wrist for release, coordinated spine twist for power transfer, and stabilizing movements of the left side for balance.
