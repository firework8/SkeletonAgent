Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'kicking something' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs a kicking action by shifting weight onto the supporting leg, swinging the kicking leg backward for momentum, then forcefully extending it forward to strike the target with the foot.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'kicking something': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains steady with eyes focused on the target.  
Hand: Typically clenched in a fist or relaxed for balance.  
Arm: Swings opposite the kicking leg to counterbalance momentum.  
Hip: Rotates forward to generate power for the kick.  
Leg: Drives forward with the knee lifting before extension.  
Foot: Strikes the target with the toes, instep, or heel.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'kicking something' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Rotates slightly to generate kicking power.  
2-middle of the spine: Stabilizes torso while hips rotate.  
3-neck: Keeps head steady for balance and focus.  
4-head: Maintains forward gaze toward the target.  
13-left hip: Drives backward for counterbalance (if right leg kicks).  
17-right hip: Rotates forward to power the kick (if right leg kicks).  
18-right knee: Flexes then extends to propel the foot forward.  
20-right foot: Strikes target with controlled impact.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'kicking something' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features recognizing a kick include hip rotation driving leg extension, knee flexion followed by forceful foot impact, torso stabilization with counterbalancing arm movements, and steady head focus on the target.
