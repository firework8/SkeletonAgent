Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'shake fist' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The 'shake fist' action involves the rapid, repetitive flexion and extension of the elbow joint while the hand is clenched into a fist, typically accompanied by slight wrist and shoulder movement to amplify the shaking motion.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'shake fist': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: May tilt slightly forward or remain upright with an intense expression.  
Hand: Clenches tightly into a fist with fingers curled inward.  
Arm: Flexes at the elbow and shakes rapidly in short, forceful motions.  
Hip: Generally remains stable with minimal movement.  
Leg: Stays grounded and stationary, bearing body weight.  
Foot: Planted firmly on the ground without shifting.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'shake fist' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
4-head: May tilt forward slightly with an intense expression.  
6-left elbow: Rapidly flexes and extends during the shaking motion.  
7-left wrist: Moves slightly to amplify the fist shake.  
8-left hand: Clenches tightly into a fist.  
10-right elbow: Rapidly flexes and extends if shaking right fist.  
11-right wrist: Moves slightly to amplify the fist shake.  
12-right hand: Clenches tightly into a fist.  
22-tip of the left hand: Remains tense as part of the clenched fist.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'shake fist' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'shake fist' action is recognized by rapid elbow flexion and extension, a tightly clenched hand, slight wrist movement, and an intense forward head tilt.
