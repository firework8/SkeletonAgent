Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'walking towards each other' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
When two people walk towards each other, their legs move in alternating strides while their arms swing naturally in opposition to their legs, maintaining balance and forward momentum as they approach one another.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'walking towards each other': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly raised with gaze forward.  
Hand: Relaxed with slight natural swing.  
Arm: Swings gently opposite to leg movement.  
Hip: Rotates slightly with each step.  
Leg: Alternates forward in a straight line.  
Foot: Heel strikes first, then rolls to toe.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'walking towards each other' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Rotates slightly with each step.  
2-middle of the spine: Stabilizes upper body during movement.  
3-neck: Supports head alignment while walking.  
4-head: Maintains forward gaze with slight stabilization.  
5-left shoulder: Swings slightly opposite left hip.  
6-left elbow: Bends and extends with arm swing.  
7-left wrist: Remains relaxed with minimal movement.  
8-left hand: Slightly swings in opposition to legs.  
9-right shoulder: Swings slightly opposite right hip.  
10-right elbow: Bends and extends with arm swing.  
11-right wrist: Remains relaxed with minimal movement.  
12-right hand: Slightly swings in opposition to legs.  
13-left hip: Rotates forward with left leg stride.  
14-left knee: Flexes and extends during stepping.  
15-left ankle: Pivots during heel-to-toe motion.  
16-left foot: Heel strikes first, then rolls forward.  
17-right hip: Rotates forward with right leg stride.  
18-right knee: Flexes and extends during stepping.  
19-right ankle: Pivots during heel-to-toe motion.  
20-right foot: Heel strikes first, then rolls forward.  
21-spine: Maintains upright posture while walking.  
22-tip of the left hand: Minimal movement, follows wrist.  
24-tip of the right hand: Minimal movement, follows wrist.  

(Note: Since you requested 4-8 if >10 critical joints, here are the top 8 most important for walking recognition:)  

5-left shoulder: Swings slightly opposite left hip.  
9-right shoulder: Swings slightly opposite right hip.  
13-left hip: Rotates forward with left leg stride.  
14-left knee: Flexes and extends during stepping.  
17-right hip: Rotates forward with right leg stride.  
18-right knee: Flexes and extends during stepping.  
15-left ankle: Pivots during heel-to-toe motion.  
19-right ankle: Pivots during heel-to-toe motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'walking towards each other' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features recognizing 'walking towards each other' are alternating shoulder and hip rotation with opposing arm swings, synchronized knee flexion and ankle pivots, maintaining forward gaze and upright posture while legs stride heel-to-toe in coordinated motion.
