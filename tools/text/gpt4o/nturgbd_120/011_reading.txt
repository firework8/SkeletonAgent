Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'reading' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'reading' action by sitting or standing with the head slightly tilted forward, eyes scanning the text, hands holding or adjusting the material, and minimal movement except for occasional page-turning or scrolling.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'reading': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward with eyes focused on the text.  
Hand: Holds or adjusts the reading material or device.  
Arm: Rests on a surface or supports the hand's position.  
Hip: Stationary, supporting seated or standing posture.  
Leg: Bent if seated or straight if standing, mostly still.  
Foot: Flat on the floor if seated, may shift if standing.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'reading' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly bent forward to focus on text.  
4-head: Tilted downward with eyes fixed on reading material.  
7-left wrist: Slightly flexed to hold book or device.  
8-left hand: Grips or supports reading material.  
11-right wrist: Slightly flexed for page-turning or scrolling.  
12-right hand: Adjusts pages or interacts with device.  
21-spine: Upright or slightly leaned forward for posture.  
22-tip of the left hand: May touch pages or screen for interaction.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'reading' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'reading' action is characterized by a forward-tilted head and neck, upright or slightly leaned spine, flexed wrists, and active hands gripping or adjusting reading material while maintaining a stable seated or standing posture.
