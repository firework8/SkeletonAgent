Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'salute' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'salute' action by raising the right hand to the forehead with fingers extended and palm facing downward, then lowering it smoothly back to the side in a controlled motion.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'salute': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright with eyes forward.  
Hand: Right hand flat, fingers extended and joined.  
Arm: Right arm raises diagonally to touch forehead.  
Hip: Stays stationary and aligned with torso.  
Leg: Both legs straight and heels together.  
Foot: Both feet flat on the ground, angled slightly outward.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'salute' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 24

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Remains straight, aligning head upright.  
4-head: Faces forward with chin level.  
9-right shoulder: Lifts slightly as arm raises.  
10-right elbow: Bends to bring hand toward forehead.  
11-right wrist: Straightens to position hand flat.  
12-right hand: Palm faces down, fingers extended together.  
21-spine: Maintains upright posture, no bending.  
24-tip of the right hand: Touches forehead briefly.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'salute' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'salute' action is recognized by the right arm raising with a straight wrist, the flat right hand touching the forehead with fingers extended, while the head, spine, and lower body remain upright and still.
