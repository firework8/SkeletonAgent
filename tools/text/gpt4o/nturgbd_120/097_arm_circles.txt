Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'arm circles' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
During the 'arm circles' action, the arms move in a continuous circular path, either forward or backward, with the shoulders acting as the pivot point while the hands trace concentric circles through the air.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'arm circles': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Typically remains stable or slightly tilted.  
Hand: Forms a loose or extended position, tracing circular paths.  
Arm: Rotates at the shoulder joint in a continuous circular motion.  
Hip: Generally stays stationary or slightly shifts for balance.  
Leg: Maintains a steady stance with minimal movement.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'arm circles' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
5-left shoulder: Rotates in a circular motion as the arm swings.  
6-left elbow: Slightly bends and extends during the circular movement.  
7-left wrist: Maintains a stable or slightly flexed position.  
9-right shoulder: Rotates in a circular motion as the arm swings.  
10-right elbow: Slightly bends and extends during the circular movement.  
11-right wrist: Maintains a stable or slightly flexed position.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'arm circles' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'arm circles' action is recognized by the shoulders rotating in circular motions while the elbows slightly bend and extend, the wrists remain stable, and the hands trace smooth, continuous paths.
