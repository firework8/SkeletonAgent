Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'drop' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performing the 'drop' action involves bending the knees and hips to lower the center of gravity while maintaining balance, often with a controlled descent to the ground or a specific target.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'drop': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts forward or stays neutral.  
Hand: Relaxes or opens slightly.  
Arm: Loosens and may lower slightly.  
Hip: Bends to lower the torso.  
Leg: Flexes at the knee to absorb impact.  
Foot: Stays planted or adjusts for balance.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'drop' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Slightly bends forward to initiate descent.  
2-middle of the spine: Flexes to lower upper body.  
3-neck: Stabilizes head alignment during movement.  
4-head: Tilts slightly forward or stays neutral.  
5-left shoulder: Relaxes as arm lowers.  
13-left hip: Bends to absorb impact.  
14-left knee: Flexes deeply to control drop.  
17-right hip: Bends symmetrically with left hip.  
18-right knee: Flexes in sync with left knee.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'drop' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'drop' action is characterized by bending at the hips and knees to lower the body, with the spine flexing forward, arms relaxing downward, and the head tilting slightly or remaining neutral for balance.
