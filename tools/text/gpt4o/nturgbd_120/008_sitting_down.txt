Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'sitting down' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'sitting down' action by bending at the hips and knees while shifting the center of gravity backward, lowering the torso until the buttocks rest on a surface.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'sitting down': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or stays upright.  
Hand: Rests on thighs or armrests, or moves for balance.  
Arm: Bends slightly at the elbow, may support the body.  
Hip: Flexes as the torso lowers toward the seat.  
Leg: Bends at the knee while supporting body weight.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground or adjusts for stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'sitting down' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Flexes forward as torso lowers.  
2-middle of the spine: Curves slightly to maintain balance.  
13-left hip: Bends to lower torso toward seat.  
14-left knee: Flexes to support body weight descent.  
17-right hip: Bends symmetrically with left hip.  
18-right knee: Flexes in sync with left knee.  
21-spine: Aligns posture during sitting motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'sitting down' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'sitting down' action is recognized by forward spine flexion, symmetrical hip and knee bending to lower the torso, and balanced posture adjustments.
