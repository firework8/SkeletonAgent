Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'open bottle' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'open bottle' action by using the fingers and thumb to grip the bottle cap, while the wrist and forearm rotate counterclockwise (for a right-handed person) to twist and loosen the cap from the bottle.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'open bottle': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains steady or slightly tilted to observe the bottle.  
Hand: Grips and twists the bottle cap with fingers and thumb.  
Arm: Rotates at the forearm and wrist to turn the cap.  
Hip: Stays stable to maintain balance.  
Leg: Supports posture with slight tension if standing.  
Foot: Grounds firmly for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'open bottle' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly stabilizes head for focus.  
4-head: Tilts slightly to observe the bottle.  
7-left wrist: Rotates to assist grip if bottle is held.  
8-left hand: Grips bottle body for stability.  
9-right shoulder: Stabilizes arm during twisting.  
10-right elbow: Provides leverage for rotation.  
11-right wrist: Twists to turn the cap.  
12-right hand: Grips and twists the cap firmly.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'open bottle' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by the head tilting slightly for focus, the right hand gripping and twisting the cap with wrist rotation, supported by elbow leverage and shoulder stability, while the left hand may steady the bottle if needed.
