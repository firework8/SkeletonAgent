Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'snapping fingers' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The 'snapping fingers' action involves pressing the thumb and middle finger together, building tension, then quickly sliding the middle finger off the thumb, creating a snapping sound from the impact against the palm.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'snapping fingers': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Typically remains still or tilts slightly in sync with the rhythm.  
Hand: Thumb and middle finger press together, then release sharply to create the snap.  
Arm: Generally relaxed, with minimal movement unless gesturing.  
Hip: Usually stationary unless swaying to music.  
Leg: Stays steady unless shifting weight for balance.  
Foot: Remains planted unless tapping to a beat.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'snapping fingers' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
4-head: May tilt slightly in rhythm with the snap.  
7-left wrist: Flexes slightly as fingers prepare to snap.  
8-left hand: Thumb and middle finger press, then release sharply.  
11-right wrist: Flexes slightly as fingers prepare to snap.  
12-right hand: Thumb and middle finger press, then release sharply.  
22-tip of the left hand: Middle finger strikes palm to create sound.  
24-tip of the right hand: Middle finger strikes palm to create sound.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'snapping fingers' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'snapping fingers' action is recognized by the thumb and middle finger pressing together then sharply releasing, causing the middle finger to strike the palm while the wrist flexes slightly and the head may tilt rhythmically.
