Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Tilts back slightly to track the cap's upward motion.  
4-head: Follows the cap's trajectory with eyes and slight upward tilt.  
7-left wrist: Flicks upward to propel the cap during release.  
8-left hand: Opens to release the cap at peak height.  
11-right wrist: Stabilizes or adjusts balance if needed.  
12-right hand: May assist or remain relaxed for balance.  
21-spine: Provides core stability during the throwing motion.  
24-tip of the right hand: Helps guide or adjust the cap's spin if used.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'throw up cap/hat' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description
