Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cutting paper (using scissors)' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'cutting paper' action by stabilizing the paper with one hand while the other hand opens and closes the scissors in a controlled, rhythmic motion, applying gentle pressure to slice through the paper along a desired line.

2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward to focus on the paper.  
Hand: Grips scissors firmly and opens/closes blades to cut.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'cutting paper (using scissors)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly bent forward to focus on the paper.  
4-head: Tilted downward to observe cutting motion.  
7-left wrist: Moves precisely to guide the paper.  
8-left hand: Holds and adjusts paper position.  
11-right wrist: Controls scissor movement with fluid motion.  
12-right hand: Grips and operates scissors to cut.  
21-spine: Maintains upright posture for stability.  
22-tip of the left hand: Fine-tunes paper alignment.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'cutting paper (using scissors)' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features recognizing the 'cutting paper' action include the head tilting forward to focus, the right hand gripping and operating scissors with controlled wrist motion, the left hand adjusting the paper position, and the spine maintaining upright stability for precision.
