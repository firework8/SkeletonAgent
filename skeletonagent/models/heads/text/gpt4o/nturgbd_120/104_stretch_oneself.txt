Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'stretch oneself' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'stretch oneself' action by extending the limbs and torso outward, elongating muscles, and often arching the back or reaching the arms overhead to relieve tension and increase flexibility.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'stretch oneself': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly back or to the side.  
Hand: Opens and extends fingers outward.  
Arm: Reaches upward or outward, elongating.  
Hip: Shifts slightly backward or tilts forward.  
Leg: Straightens or extends away from the body.  
Foot: Points toes or lifts slightly off the ground.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'stretch oneself' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Tilts slightly backward or to the side.  
4-head: Lifts upward or tilts back.  
5-left shoulder: Raises and rotates outward.  
6-left elbow: Extends to straighten the arm.  
9-right shoulder: Raises and rotates outward.  
10-right elbow: Extends to straighten the arm.  
21-spine: Arches or elongates backward.  
22-tip of the left hand: Reaches upward or outward.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'stretch oneself' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'stretch oneself' action is recognized by upward or outward arm extension with straightened elbows, raised and rotated shoulders, a backward-tilted head and neck, an arched spine, and reaching hand movements.
