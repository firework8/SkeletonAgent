Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
4-head: Slightly tilted forward with focused gaze tracking balls.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to aid arm movement during tosses.  
6-left elbow: Flexes and extends to control tossing height.  
7-left wrist: Quick flicks to propel balls upward.  
9-right shoulder: Rotates slightly to aid arm movement during tosses.  
10-right elbow: Flexes and extends to control tossing height.  
11-right wrist: Quick flicks to propel balls upward.  
21-spine: Maintains upright posture with subtle balance adjustments.
