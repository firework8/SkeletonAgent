Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'arm swings' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'arm swings' action by moving the arms rhythmically back and forth from the shoulders, either alternately or simultaneously, while maintaining a stable torso and relaxed joints.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'arm swings': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains stable or moves slightly in sync with arm motion.  
Hand: Relaxes or forms a loose fist, swinging naturally.  
Arm: Moves back and forth from the shoulder with controlled momentum.  
Hip: May rotate slightly opposite the swinging arm for balance.  
Leg: Stays grounded or steps lightly in coordination with swings.  
Foot: Maintains contact with the ground or shifts weight as needed.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'arm swings' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
5-left shoulder: Rotates forward and backward during swing.  
6-left elbow: Bends slightly, allowing arm to swing freely.  
7-left wrist: Remains loose, following arm motion naturally.  
9-right shoulder: Rotates opposite left shoulder for balance.  
10-right elbow: Bends slightly, mirroring left arm movement.  
11-right wrist: Stays relaxed, moving with arm swing.  
21-spine: Provides stability with slight rotational adjustment.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'arm swings' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'arm swings' action is recognized by rhythmic forward-backward shoulder rotations, slight elbow bends, relaxed wrists, and stabilizing spine adjustments, with opposing arm movements maintaining balance.
