Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'hand waving' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'hand waving' action by moving the arm at the shoulder or elbow joint while keeping the wrist relaxed, causing the hand to oscillate back and forth in a rhythmic motion.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'hand waving': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Typically remains still or slightly nods in acknowledgment.  
Hand: Opens and moves side to side in a rhythmic motion.  
Arm: Swings gently from the shoulder or elbow to facilitate the hand wave.  
Hip: Generally stays stationary with minimal movement.  
Leg: Remains straight or slightly bent but mostly inactive.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground without shifting.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'hand waving' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
4-head: Typically remains still or slightly nods.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to enable arm movement.  
6-left elbow: Bends and extends to swing the forearm.  
7-left wrist: Moves flexibly to direct the hand wave.  
9-right shoulder: Rotates slightly to facilitate arm motion.  
10-right elbow: Bends and extends for forearm swing.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts angle to guide hand waving.  
12-right hand: Opens and moves side to side rhythmically.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'hand waving' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'hand waving' action is primarily recognized by rhythmic side-to-side movement of the hand, guided by wrist flexibility and supported by slight elbow and shoulder rotation, while the head remains mostly still.
