Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'bounce ball' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'bounce ball' action by bending the knees and hips to lower the torso, then explosively extending the legs and swinging the arms upward to propel the body vertically off the ground before landing softly with bent joints to absorb the impact.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'bounce ball': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly nods forward to maintain balance.  
Hand: Grips the ball firmly with fingers spread.  
Arm: Bends at the elbow, then extends upward to push the ball down.  
Hip: Flexes slightly to lower the torso before bouncing.  
Leg: Bends at the knee, then quickly straightens to propel upward.  
Foot: Pushes off the ground with the toes for lift.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'bounce ball' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly tilts forward to stabilize the head.  
4-head: Nods forward to maintain balance during the bounce.  
7-left wrist: Flexes to control the ball's downward push.  
11-right wrist: Extends to guide the ball's downward motion.  
14-left knee: Bends then extends to propel the body upward.  
18-right knee: Flexes then straightens for upward force.  
21-spine: Maintains slight flexion for torso alignment.  
22-tip of the left hand: Contacts the ball for control.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'bounce ball' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'bounce ball' action is recognized by coordinated knee flexion and extension for upward propulsion, wrist and hand movements to control the ball's bounce, a forward head tilt for balance, and spinal alignment to stabilize the torso.
