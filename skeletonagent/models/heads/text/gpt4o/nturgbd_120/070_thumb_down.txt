Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'thumb down' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The 'thumb down' action involves the contraction of forearm muscles to flex the thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joint, extending it downward while the other fingers typically remain relaxed or slightly curled.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'thumb down': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Typically remains neutral or slightly tilted in disapproval.  
Hand: Thumb extends downward while fingers may relax or curl slightly.  
Arm: May stay relaxed or move slightly forward to emphasize the gesture.  
Hip: Generally remains stable with no significant movement.  
Leg: Usually stays stationary unless stepping or shifting weight.  
Foot: Remains flat on the ground or maintains natural stance.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'thumb down' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: May slightly tilt forward or remain neutral.  
4-head: Typically faces forward or angles downward slightly.  
7-left wrist: Stays relaxed or bends slightly inward.  
8-left hand: Fingers may curl loosely while thumb extends down.  
11-right wrist: Flexes to position thumb downward.  
12-right hand: Thumb points down, fingers may relax or curl.  
23-left thumb: Extends downward if left hand is used.  
25-right thumb: Actively extends downward in the gesture.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'thumb down' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'thumb down' action is primarily recognized by the downward extension of the thumb, often accompanied by slight wrist flexion, relaxed fingers, and minimal head or neck movement to convey disapproval.
