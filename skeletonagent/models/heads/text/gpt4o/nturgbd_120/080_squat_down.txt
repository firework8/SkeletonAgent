Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'squat down' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
When performing a 'squat down' action, the human body bends at the hips, knees, and ankles while lowering the torso and pelvis toward the ground, maintaining balance with the feet flat and the spine aligned.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'squat down': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts forward to maintain balance.  
Hand: May rest on hips or extend forward for stability.  
Arm: Hangs loosely or bends slightly if hands are raised.  
Hip: Hinges backward while lowering the torso downward.  
Leg: Bends at the knee as thighs move parallel to the ground.  
Foot: Stays flat on the floor with weight evenly distributed.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'squat down' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Hinges backward as torso lowers.  
2-middle of the spine: Maintains alignment while bending slightly forward.  
13-left hip: Flexes as thigh moves downward and backward.  
14-left knee: Bends to lower body toward ground.  
17-right hip: Flexes as thigh moves downward and backward.  
18-right knee: Bends to lower body toward ground.  
21-spine: Curves slightly forward during descent.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'squat down' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'squat down' action is recognized by the hips hinging backward, knees bending to lower the body, spine maintaining slight forward curvature, and feet staying flat with weight evenly distributed.
