Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'nausea or vomiting condition' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body's movement process during nausea or vomiting involves a coordinated sequence where the diaphragm and abdominal muscles contract forcefully, the glottis closes to prevent aspiration, the soft palate rises to block the nasal passage, and the stomach's contents are expelled through the mouth via rhythmic antiperistaltic waves.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'nausea or vomiting condition': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: May tilt forward or backward with discomfort.  
Hand: Often clutches stomach or covers mouth.  
Arm: May brace against a surface for support.  
Hip: Typically remains still or slightly hunched.  
Leg: Muscles may tense or weaken slightly.  
Foot: Often shifts weight for balance.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'nausea or vomiting condition' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 21

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Slightly hunched forward during retching.  
2-middle of the spine: Contracts with abdominal muscle tension.  
3-neck: Often flexed forward as head tilts down.  
4-head: Tilts forward or backward in discomfort.  
5-left shoulder: May rise slightly during gag reflex.  
7-left wrist: Often bends as hand covers mouth.  
8-left hand: Covers mouth or clutches stomach.  
9-right shoulder: May rise slightly during gag reflex.  
11-right wrist: Often bends as hand covers mouth.  
12-right hand: Covers mouth or clutches stomach.  
21-spine: Arches or contracts during vomiting motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'nausea or vomiting condition' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features recognizing nausea or vomiting include a hunched spine, forward head tilt, hands covering the mouth or clutching the stomach, raised shoulders, bent wrists, and abdominal muscle contractions during retching.
