Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'step on foot' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'step on foot' action by shifting weight onto one leg, lifting the opposite foot, and then placing it down onto or over the other foot with controlled movement.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'step on foot': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains steady or slightly tilted for balance.  
Hand: May relax or slightly tense for stability.  
Arm: Swings slightly or stays neutral for coordination.  
Hip: Shifts weight to the supporting side.  
Leg: Lifts slightly to allow stepping motion.  
Foot: Raises and lowers to press or brush the other foot.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'step on foot' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
4-head: Remains steady or slightly tilted for balance.  
5-left shoulder: Adjusts slightly for arm swing coordination.  
13-left hip: Shifts weight to support stepping motion.  
14-left knee: Flexes to lift the left foot.  
15-left ankle: Controls foot elevation and placement.  
17-right hip: Stabilizes during weight transfer.  
18-right knee: Slightly bends to absorb impact.  
20-right foot: Receives step or brushes against left foot.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'step on foot' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'step on foot' action is recognized by a weight shift to one hip, slight knee flexion for foot elevation, controlled ankle movement for placement, and stabilizing adjustments in the shoulders and head for balance.
