Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'walking apart from each other' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'walking apart from each other' action by moving opposite legs forward in alternating strides while maintaining balance, with each person stepping away from the other in synchronized or mirrored motion.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'walking apart from each other': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to face away or maintains forward gaze.  
Hand: Swings naturally or stays relaxed at the sides.  
Arm: Moves in opposition to legs with a gentle swing.  
Hip: Rotates slightly forward with each step.  
Leg: Alternates forward strides to create distance.  
Foot: Lifts and steps heel-to-toe away from the other person.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'walking apart from each other' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Rotates slightly with hip movement.  
2-middle of the spine: Stabilizes upper body during stepping.  
3-neck: Supports head turning or forward gaze.  
4-head: Faces forward or turns slightly away.  
5-left shoulder: Moves in sync with left arm swing.  
6-left elbow: Bends slightly during arm swing.  
7-left wrist: Remains relaxed with hand movement.  
8-left hand: Swings naturally or stays loose.  
9-right shoulder: Moves in sync with right arm swing.  
10-right elbow: Bends slightly during arm swing.  
11-right wrist: Remains relaxed with hand movement.  
12-right hand: Swings naturally or stays loose.  
13-left hip: Rotates forward with left leg step.  
14-left knee: Flexes and extends during stride.  
15-left ankle: Pivots for heel-to-toe motion.  
16-left foot: Lifts and steps away.  
17-right hip: Rotates forward with right leg step.  
18-right knee: Flexes and extends during stride.  
19-right ankle: Pivots for heel-to-toe motion.  
20-right foot: Lifts and steps away.  
21-spine: Maintains upright posture while walking.  
22-tip of the left hand: Minimal movement, follows wrist.  
23-left thumb: Relaxed, no active motion.  
24-tip of the right hand: Minimal movement, follows wrist.  
25-right thumb: Relaxed, no active motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'walking apart from each other' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by alternating leg strides with hip rotation, synchronized arm swings opposite to legs, a stable upright spine, and forward or slightly turned head orientation as both individuals move away from each other.
