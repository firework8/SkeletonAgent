Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'jump up' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'jump up' action by bending the knees, explosively extending the legs and hips to propel upward, swinging the arms for momentum, and leaving the ground momentarily before gravity pulls it back down.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'jump up': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or stays neutral for balance.  
Hand: Fingers may spread or stay relaxed for stability.  
Arm: Swings upward to generate momentum.  
Hip: Flexes slightly before extending forcefully.  
Leg: Bends then extends explosively to propel upward.  
Foot: Pushes off the ground using toes and ball.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'jump up' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Flexes slightly then extends forcefully upward.  
2-middle of the spine: Straightens to align with jumping motion.  
3-neck: Stabilizes to keep head balanced.  
4-head: Tilts slightly forward for momentum.  
5-left shoulder: Lifts as arm swings up.  
6-left elbow: Bends then extends for arm swing.  
9-right shoulder: Lifts as arm swings up.  
10-right elbow: Bends then extends for arm swing.  
13-left hip: Flexes then extends explosively.  
14-left knee: Bends deeply then straightens to push off.  
17-right hip: Flexes then extends explosively.  
18-right knee: Bends deeply then straightens to push off.  
21-spine: Extends fully during upward thrust.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'jump up' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'jump up' action is recognized by forceful hip and knee extension driving upward propulsion, coordinated with arm swings for momentum, spine alignment for stability, and slight head tilt for balance.
