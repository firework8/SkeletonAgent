Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'follow other person' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'follow other person' action by coordinating visual tracking (eyes), adjusting posture and balance (core and legs), and moving the limbs (legs and arms) to walk or run in the direction of the other person while maintaining a steady pace and distance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'follow other person': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns and tilts to track the other person visually.  
Hand: Remains relaxed or slightly flexed for balance.  
Arm: Swings naturally in sync with walking motion.  
Hip: Rotates slightly with each step to aid movement.  
Leg: Alternates strides to propel the body forward.  
Foot: Lifts and steps to maintain pace and direction.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'follow other person' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-base of the spine: Rotates slightly to coordinate leg movements.  
2-middle of the spine: Maintains posture while allowing upper body rotation.  
3-neck: Adjusts angle to keep head aligned with movement direction.  
4-head: Turns to visually track the person being followed.  
5-left shoulder: Swings forward with left arm during stepping.  
9-right shoulder: Swings forward with right arm during stepping.  
13-left hip: Drives left leg forward in walking motion.  
17-right hip: Drives right leg forward in walking motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'follow other person' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'follow other person' action is recognized by coordinated head rotation for visual tracking, rhythmic arm swings synchronized with opposite leg strides, slight spine rotation for balance, and forward-driven hip movements propelling alternating steps to maintain pace and direction.
