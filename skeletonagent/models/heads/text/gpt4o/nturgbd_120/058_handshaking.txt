Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'handshaking' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'handshaking' action by extending one arm forward, grasping another person's hand with a firm yet gentle grip, and moving the joined hands up and down briefly in a rhythmic motion.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'handshaking': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Typically held upright with eye contact and a slight nod or smile.  
Hand: Grips the other person's hand firmly but not tightly, with fingers interlocked.  
Arm: Extends forward from the shoulder, elbow slightly bent, facilitating the up-down motion.  
Hip: Remains stable and aligned with the torso, providing balance.  
Leg: Bears body weight evenly, maintaining an upright posture.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground, ensuring stability during the motion.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'handshaking' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly tilts forward to facilitate engagement.  
4-head: Maintains upright posture with eye contact.  
7-left wrist: Bends slightly to adjust handshake grip.  
8-left hand: Opens and closes to grasp the other hand.  
11-right wrist: Flexes to guide the up-down motion.  
12-right hand: Grips firmly and moves rhythmically.  
21-spine: Provides stability and upright posture.  
24-tip of the right hand: Makes initial contact before full grip.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'handshaking' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'handshaking' action is recognized by an upright posture with eye contact, a slight forward tilt of the neck, coordinated wrist and hand movements to establish a firm grip, and rhythmic up-and-down motion driven by the right hand while maintaining spinal stability.
