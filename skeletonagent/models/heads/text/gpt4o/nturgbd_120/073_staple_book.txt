Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'staple book' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'staple book' action by bending at the waist, extending the arms forward to align the stapler over the paper, and pressing down with the hand to engage the stapler's mechanism, securing the pages together.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'staple book': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts forward to observe the stapling.  
Hand: Grips and presses the stapler firmly.  
Arm: Extends forward to position the stapler.

Leg: Supports balance with knees slightly bent.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'staple book' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly bends forward to focus on stapling.  
4-head: Tilts down to observe the paper and stapler.  
7-left wrist: Adjusts angle to position stapler.  
8-left hand: Grips and presses stapler firmly.  
11-right wrist: Stabilizes paper if needed.  
12-right hand: Holds paper in place.  
21-spine: Leans forward slightly for reach.  
24-tip of the right hand: Assists in aligning paper.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'staple book' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'staple book' action is recognized by a forward head tilt, slight spine lean, precise wrist adjustments for stapler positioning, firm hand grip to press the stapler, and stabilizing hand movements to align the paper.
