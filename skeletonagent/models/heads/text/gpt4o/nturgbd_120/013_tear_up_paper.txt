Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'tear up paper' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'tear up paper' action by gripping the paper with both hands, applying opposing forces with the arms and wrists, and pulling in opposite directions to split the paper apart.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'tear up paper': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward to focus on the paper.  
Hand: Fingers grip and pull the paper in opposite directions.  
Arm: Forearms rotate slightly while applying tension to tear.  
Hip: Remains stable to support upper body movement.  
Leg: Knees stay slightly bent for balance.  
Foot: Flat on the ground to maintain posture.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'tear up paper' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly bent forward to focus on the paper.  
4-head: Tilted downward to observe the tearing action.  
7-left wrist: Twists slightly to apply tension on the paper.  
8-left hand: Grips and pulls the paper outward.  
11-right wrist: Twists slightly to apply opposing tension.  
12-right hand: Grips and pulls the paper in the opposite direction.  
21-spine: Stabilizes posture for upper body movement.  
22-tip of the left hand: Adjusts grip for precise tearing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'tear up paper' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'tear up paper' action is recognized by coordinated hand gripping and pulling motions with opposing wrist twists, slight forward head tilt, spine stabilization, and precise finger adjustments to split the paper apart.
