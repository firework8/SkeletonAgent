Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'sniff (smell)' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
When performing the 'sniff' action, the human body inhales sharply through the nostrils, drawing air upward into the nasal cavity to detect odors, often accompanied by a slight flaring of the nostrils and a quick, repeated inhalation pattern.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'sniff (smell)': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or upward to inhale.  
Hand: Typically remains still or may gesture near the nose.  
Arm: Stays relaxed at the sides or slightly bent.  
Hip: Remains stable with no significant movement.  
Leg: Stays stationary to maintain balance.  
Foot: Grounded firmly with no motion.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'sniff (smell)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
4-head: Tilts slightly forward or upward to inhale.  
5-left shoulder: May lift slightly to aid sniffing posture.  
7-left wrist: Stays relaxed or bends slightly inward.  
8-left hand: May rise toward the nose subtly.  
9-right shoulder: May lift slightly to aid sniffing posture.  
11-right wrist: Stays relaxed or bends slightly inward.  
12-right hand: May rise toward the nose subtly.  
22-tip of the left hand: Moves slightly if hand gestures near nose.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'sniff (smell)' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'sniff' action is recognized by the head tilting slightly forward or upward, shoulders lifting subtly, wrists bending inward, and hands rising toward the nose in a brief inhalation motion.
