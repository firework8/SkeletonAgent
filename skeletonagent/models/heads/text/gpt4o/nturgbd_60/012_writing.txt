Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'writing' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
When writing, the human body engages a coordinated movement where the fingers and thumb grip the pen, the wrist and forearm guide its motion across the surface, and the shoulder stabilizes the arm while subtle shifts in posture maintain balance and comfort.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'writing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to focus on the writing surface.  
Hand: Grips the pen and controls fine movements for letter formation.  
Arm: Moves smoothly to guide the hand across the page.  
Hip: Remains stable to support upper body posture.  
Leg: Stays bent or relaxed to maintain seated balance.  
Foot: Rests flat or lightly on the floor for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'writing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Slightly flexed to tilt head forward for focus.  
4-head: Tilts downward to view writing surface.  
7-left wrist: Adjusts angle for pen control and smooth strokes.  
8-left hand: Grips pen and executes fine finger movements.  
11-right wrist: Stabilizes if used for paper positioning.  
12-right hand: May assist in holding or adjusting paper.  
21-spine: Maintains upright posture with slight forward lean.  
22-tip of the left hand: Refines pen pressure and precision.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'writing' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The writing action is recognized by a forward head tilt, precise wrist and hand movements for pen control, stabilized posture from the spine, and subtle finger adjustments for fine motor execution.
