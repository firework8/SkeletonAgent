Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'brushing teeth' action in a sentence.

Round 1 Answer:
When brushing teeth, the human body typically moves the forearm and wrist in a back-and-forth or circular motion to guide the toothbrush across the teeth while the head tilts slightly for better access, and the non-dominant hand may hold a cup or stabilize the sink for balance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'brushing teeth': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or sideways for better access.  
Hand: Grips toothbrush and moves in short strokes or circles.  
Arm: Flexes at elbow to guide toothbrush motion.  
Hip: Remains stable to maintain balance.  
Leg: Bears body weight with slight bend in knees.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground for support.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 25 skeleton joints. 
The labels of the joints are: 1-base of the spine, 2-middle of the spine, 3-neck, 4-head, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-left hand, 9-right shoulder, 10-right elbow, 11-right wrist, 12-right hand, 13-left hip, 14-left knee, 15-left ankle, 16-left foot, 17-right hip, 18-right knee, 19-right ankle, 20-right foot, 21-spine, 22-tip of the left hand, 23-left thumb, 24-tip of the right hand, and 25-right thumb. 
Based on the movement process of the 'brushing teeth' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-25)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
3-neck: Tilts slightly forward or sideways for tooth access.  
4-head: Adjusts angle to align mouth with brush.  
7-left wrist: Rotates and flexes to guide brushing motion.  
8-left hand: Grips toothbrush and moves in strokes/circles.  
11-right wrist: Stabilizes or assists if using opposite hand.  
12-right hand: Holds cup or counter for balance if not brushing.  
21-spine: Maintains upright posture with slight forward lean.  
22-tip of the left hand: Fine-tunes brush contact with teeth.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'brushing teeth' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features recognizing 'brushing teeth' include a tilted head and neck for access, coordinated wrist and hand movements guiding the toothbrush in strokes or circles, a stabilized spine for posture, and potential opposite-hand support for balance.
