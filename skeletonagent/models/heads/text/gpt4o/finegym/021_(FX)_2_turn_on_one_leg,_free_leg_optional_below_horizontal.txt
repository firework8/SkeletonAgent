Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the element by standing on one leg with the free leg lifted below horizontal, then rotates 720 degrees in a smooth, continuous turn while maintaining a straight supporting leg and controlled free leg position, with the arms transitioning from an initial open position to a closed, compact shape to accelerate rotation before returning to a stable finish with the free leg still held below horizontal.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright and aligned with the spine, turning steadily with the rotation to maintain balance and focus.  
Hand: Starts open or slightly curved, then tightens into a compact shape near the chest mid-turn to increase rotational speed.  
Arm: Begins extended outward for balance, then pulls inward sharply to accelerate the turn before re-extending for stability.  
Hip: Stays level and square to the direction of rotation, avoiding excessive tilt to ensure a clean, controlled pivot.  
Leg: Free leg remains bent or straight below horizontal, held precisely to avoid rising above required height.  
Foot: Supporting foot pivots smoothly on the ball, maintaining consistent pressure to avoid wobbling or hopping.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Pulls inward sharply mid-turn to accelerate rotation before re-extending for stability.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in timing for controlled deceleration.  
12-left hip: Maintains level alignment with minimal tilt, anchoring the free leg’s position below horizontal.  
13-right hip: Stabilizes the supporting leg’s rotation, resisting excessive sway for clean pivoting.  
14-left knee: Free leg’s knee remains either softly bent or straight, never exceeding horizontal height.  
17-right ankle: Supporting ankle stays rigid on the ball of the foot, enabling smooth, continuous rotation.  
19-thorax: Rotates as a single unit with shoulders and hips, preventing upper/lower body separation.  
20-mid shoulder: Initiates turn alignment early, ensuring shoulders stay square to rotation axis.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a controlled 720° pivot on a rigid supporting leg with the free leg held precisely below horizontal, coordinated through sharp inward arm pulls for rotation speed while maintaining level hips and square shoulders throughout the turn.
