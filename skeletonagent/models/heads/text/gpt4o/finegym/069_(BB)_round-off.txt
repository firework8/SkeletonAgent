Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) round-off' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a forward run, plants hands on the beam while rotating sideways, swings legs upward in a wide arc with the leading leg initiating the rotation, transitions through a handstand position with legs splitting, pushes off the hands to snap the hips and shoulders around, and lands with both feet simultaneously on the beam, completing a 180-degree turn from takeoff to landing.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) round-off' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns sideways early to spot the beam, then whips backward to drive rotation, unlike a cartwheel where it stays neutral.  
Hand: Plants sideways with fingers facing the opposite shoulder, allowing a forceful push-off unlike a cartwheel’s straight placement.  
Arm: Drives upward then bends sharply during hand contact to generate rotational power, unlike a back handspring’s straighter arm motion.  
Hip: Snaps aggressively from an open to closed position mid-flight, creating the round-off’s 180° turn instead of a cartwheel’s continuous split.  
Leg: Leading leg swings upward in a wide arc while the trailing leg follows forcefully, ensuring a simultaneous landing unlike a cartwheel’s staggered touchdown.  
Foot: Lands with both feet together in a rebound-ready stance, contrasting a cartwheel’s sequential foot placement.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) round-off', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) round-off' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates early upward drive, then rotates aggressively inward to propel the round-off’s 180° turn.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but delays rotation slightly to maintain control before the snap.  
12-left hip: Opens wide during leg swing, then snaps sharply closed to generate rotational force.  
13-right hip: Follows left hip but remains slightly more extended until the final push-off.  
18-mid hip: Acts as the pivot point, rapidly shifting from backward tilt to forward thrust mid-flight.  
19-thorax: Rotates late but forcefully, aligning with the hips to complete the turn.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes early, then tilts sideways to guide the hand placement and rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) round-off' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The round-off is distinguished by a forceful sideways handplant with whipping shoulder rotation, a rapid hip snap into a 180° turn, and a simultaneous two-foot landing, unlike cartwheels' staggered touchdown or back handsprings' backward momentum.
