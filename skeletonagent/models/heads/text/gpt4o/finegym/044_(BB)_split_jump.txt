Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) split jump' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a powerful forward run, transitions into a hurdle step to generate upward momentum, then explosively leaps off both feet while simultaneously splitting the legs rapidly into a wide straddle position (near 180 degrees) with arms extended dynamically upward or sideways, achieving peak height mid-air, before swiftly bringing the legs back together and preparing for a controlled landing on both feet with knees slightly bent to absorb impact.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) split jump' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Neutral or slightly lifted, gaze forward to maintain balance, avoiding excessive tilt to distinguish from stag jumps.  
Hand: Fingers extended, palms face slightly outward during takeoff, then dynamically reach upward or sideways to accentuate split.  
Arm: Swiftly swing upward from shoulder in sync with leg split, maintaining straight lines (no elbow bend) for maximum amplitude.  
Hip: Remains square and stable during takeoff, then briefly opens laterally to allow full 180° leg split without forward rotation.  
Leg: Active, rapid split into near-180° straddle mid-air, with straight knees and pointed toes, differentiating from tuck jumps.  
Foot: Strong push-off from full foot contact, then immediate toe-pointing mid-split for clean lines, unlike relaxed leaps.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) split jump', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) split jump' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates upward arm swing early, remains open and stable to support split momentum.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, ensuring symmetrical arm extension for balance during peak split.  
12-left hip: Rapidly opens laterally mid-air, achieving near-180° split with controlled hip alignment.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip's motion precisely, maintaining symmetry and full split amplitude.  
14-left knee: Fully extends mid-split with no bend, toes pointed for clean line distinction.  
15-right knee: Mirrors left knee, ensuring equal leg extension to avoid stag-like asymmetry.  
18-mid hip: Stays centered and square during takeoff, briefly tilts minimally to accommodate split.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors arm lift, remains level to prevent torso rotation during flight.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) split jump' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The split jump is distinguished by its explosive symmetrical takeoff, precise 180° mid-air leg split with locked knees and pointed toes, square hips and shoulders throughout, and dynamic upward arm swing—all executed without torso rotation or stag-like asymmetry.
