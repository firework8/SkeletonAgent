Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) straddle pike or side split jump with 1 turn' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a powerful run or hurdle, then leaps upward with legs rapidly splitting into a wide straddle or side split position while simultaneously initiating a 180-degree turn, maintaining a straight torso and pointed toes; at the peak, the arms swing dynamically to aid rotation, then the legs snap together mid-air as the turn completes 360 degrees before landing with feet together, absorbing impact through bent knees and controlled arm placement.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) straddle pike or side split jump with 1 turn' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Stays neutral or slightly lifted, tracking rotation to maintain balance without excessive tilt.  
Hand: Begins open, then sharply closes during arm swing to generate rotational momentum.  
Arm: Swings upward dynamically, then pulls inward asymmetrically to drive the 360° turn.  
Hip: Remains square at takeoff, then opens sharply into a straddle or split with controlled flexibility.  
Leg: Extends fully at takeoff, then splits laterally with precise 180° separation mid-turn.  
Foot: Points aggressively at peak height, then snaps together before landing to complete the turn.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) straddle pike or side split jump with 1 turn', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) straddle pike or side split jump with 1 turn' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward asymmetrically in takeoff, then pulls sharply inward to initiate rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but delays slightly to enhance rotational torque during the turn.  
12-left hip: Opens explosively to 180° in the straddle, maintaining height longer than standard jumps.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but with controlled asymmetry to stabilize mid-air rotation.  
14-left knee: Extends fully at takeoff, then bends minimally to accentuate split amplitude.  
15-right knee: Synchronizes with left but remains straighter to emphasize split precision.  
18-mid hip: Stays centered but tilts forward slightly to counterbalance the straddle momentum.  
20-mid shoulder: Rotates crisply with the turn, aligning with hips for a clean 360° completion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) straddle pike or side split jump with 1 turn' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by an explosive straddle split reaching 180° mid-air combined with a sharp 360° turn driven by asymmetrical shoulder torque, precise hip alignment, and delayed knee flexion to emphasize amplitude and rotation control.
