Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) counter piked over high bar to hang' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the '(UB) counter piked over high bar to hang' by swinging backward with straight arms and a slightly arched body, then dynamically pikes at the hips as the legs drive upward and forward over the bar, transitioning into a tight pike position while the shoulders and arms remain extended, before the body unfurls into a controlled hang with legs descending and the torso aligning vertically under the bar, completing the movement smoothly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) counter piked over high bar to hang' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly back early in the swing, then tucks sharply forward as the pike initiates to aid rotation over the bar.  
Hand: Maintains a firm grip throughout, shifting pressure dynamically as the body rotates backward then forward over the bar.  
Arm: Stays straight and rigid during the backward swing, then actively pulls slightly to assist the pike-over motion.  
Hip: Sharply flexes (pikes) at peak backward swing, driving upward and forward to create the counter-rotation over the bar.  
Leg: Extends straight during backswing, then lifts aggressively in sync with hip pike to generate momentum for the over-bar clearance.  
Foot: Points toes throughout, with feet leading the upward-forward motion in the pike, distinguishing it from a straddle or layout variation.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) counter piked over high bar to hang', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) counter piked over high bar to hang' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with slight retraction, then protracts sharply as pike drives over the bar.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in timing during aggressive pike rotation.  
12-left hip: Flexes explosively (near 90°) at peak backswing, driving legs upward-forward to clear the bar.  
13-right hip: Synchronizes with left hip but may exhibit minor delay to control rotation in counter-motion.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point for rapid piking, maintaining alignment until legs clear the bar.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes rotation axis, shifting forward late to assist in counter-pike momentum.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) counter piked over high bar to hang' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a sharp, explosive hip pike at the peak of the backward swing, driving the legs upward and forward with rigid shoulders, creating a rapid counter-rotation over the bar before smoothly extending into the hang.
