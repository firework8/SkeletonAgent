Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) split jump with 1 turn' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the split jump with a powerful takeoff from both feet, simultaneously driving the arms upward and rotating 180 degrees in the air while splitting the legs into a wide straddle position (near 180 degrees), then swiftly brings the legs back together and completes the remaining 180 degrees of the turn before landing with feet together, maintaining control and alignment throughout the flight phase.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) split jump with 1 turn' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Neutral alignment with a slight upward focus during takeoff, turning sharply with the rotation to maintain balance.  
Hand: Palms face inward at takeoff, then actively drive upward to initiate rotation before closing near the chest mid-air.  
Arm: Extends forcefully upward at takeoff, then pulls inward symmetrically to accelerate the 360° turn.  
Hip: Remains square at takeoff, then splits open (180°) mid-air while rotating, ensuring equal leg separation.  
Leg: Rapidly splits into a straddle (near 180°) at peak height, maintaining straight knees and pointed toes.  
Foot: Pushes explosively off the floor, stays fully pointed mid-air, and lands softly with feet together after rotation.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) split jump with 1 turn', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) split jump with 1 turn' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward sharply at takeoff, then pulls inward symmetrically with the right shoulder to initiate rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, maintaining equal force and timing to ensure a controlled 360° turn.  
12-left hip: Opens explosively to 180° at peak height, aligning with right hip for a clean split position.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip’s split angle precisely, ensuring symmetry and full extension mid-air.  
18-mid hip: Remains centered during rotation, stabilizing the split and preventing lateral tilt.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors the turn, staying aligned with mid-hip to avoid over-rotation or wobble.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) split jump with 1 turn' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is recognized by its explosive upward drive into a symmetrical 180° split while executing a precise 360° turn, distinguished by the synchronized shoulder pull for rotation, centered hip alignment, and controlled mid-air posture before landing.
