Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) stalder backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a handstand on the uneven bars, then smoothly lowers the body backward with straight arms and a slight arch, transitioning into a stalder position with legs split wide; as momentum builds, the hips drive upward while the legs swing backward in a circular motion, the body rotates 360 degrees around the bar with controlled shoulder and core tension, and the legs seamlessly close together to finish in a vertical handstand, maintaining fluidity and precision throughout the entire movement.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) stalder backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral or slightly tilted back early, then aligns with spine during rotation to spot the bar, aiding control.  
Hand: Maintains a firm grip with slight wrist adjustments to accommodate backward swing and rotation.  
Arm: Stays straight and rigid throughout, resisting flexion to prevent collapse during the backward stalder transition.  
Hip: Initiates backward swing with controlled arch, then sharply flexes upward during rotation to generate momentum.  
Leg: Splits wide in stalder, then swings dynamically backward in a circular path, driving rotation while maintaining symmetry.  
Foot: Points sharply in the split, then snaps together late in rotation to finish in a tight handstand.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) stalder backward with 1 turn to handstand', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) stalder backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with slight depression, then rotates externally during the stalder transition.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show delayed rotation due to dominant-side control.  
12-left hip: Drives upward sharply mid-swing, opening beyond 150° in stalder before snapping closed.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but with tighter control to maintain symmetry in rotation.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, arching early then flexing explosively to propel rotation.  
19-thorax: Maintains slight arch early, then aligns rigidly with shoulders during handstand finish.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes rotation, resisting collapse as arms stay locked throughout.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) stalder backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a controlled backward stalder swing with wide leg split, explosive hip flexion driving a 360° rotation, and rigid straight-arm posture, finishing in a tight handstand with no shoulder collapse.
