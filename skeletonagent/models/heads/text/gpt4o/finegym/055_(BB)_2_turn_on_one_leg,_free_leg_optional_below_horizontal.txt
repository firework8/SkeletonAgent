Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins on one leg with the free leg slightly lifted, then initiates a controlled, continuous 360-degree turn on the supporting leg while maintaining balance, with the free leg optionally swinging or held below horizontal throughout the rotation, ensuring smooth weight transfer and precise alignment of the torso, arms, and head to guide the movement, finishing in the starting position with the free leg still optionally extended or relaxed below horizontal.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns smoothly with the rotation, gaze fixed forward to maintain balance, contrasting with turns where the head whips or lags.  
Hand: Maintains controlled positioning, often slightly curved or open, aiding balance without excessive swinging like in faster turns.  
Arm: Holds a steady, slightly rounded shape at shoulder height or lower, ensuring symmetry rather than asymmetrical flourishes.  
Hip: Stays level and aligned over the supporting leg, avoiding excessive tilt or sway seen in less controlled turns.  
Leg: Free leg remains straight or slightly bent below horizontal, distinguishing it from higher or dynamically swinging variations.  
Foot: Supporting foot pivots cleanly on the ball, with minimal heel contact, unlike flat-footed or dragging turns.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes slightly lowered, rotating smoothly with torso to control turn momentum.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may adjust subtly to counterbalance free leg position.  
12-left hip: Anchors rotation, staying aligned over supporting leg with minimal lateral shift.  
13-right hip: Controls free leg elevation, maintaining precise below-horizontal alignment throughout turn.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, remaining centered over supporting foot for clean rotation.  
20-mid shoulder: Rotates in sync with hips but delays slightly to prevent over-rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) 2 turn on one leg, free leg optional below horizontal' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This turn is distinguished by its controlled single-leg pivot with the free leg held steadily below horizontal, precise hip-shoulder alignment during rotation, and minimal upper-body sway, contrasting with faster or higher-legged variations.
