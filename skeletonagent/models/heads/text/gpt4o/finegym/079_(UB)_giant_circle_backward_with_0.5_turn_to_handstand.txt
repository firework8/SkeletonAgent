Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) giant circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a handstand on the uneven bars, then initiates a backward giant swing by arching slightly and allowing the body to descend, accelerating through the bottom with a hollow body position, then lifting the hips and shoulders to generate momentum, completing a 180-degree turn during the upward phase by shifting the arms and rotating the torso, and finally regaining the handstand position with controlled precision, maintaining straight arms and a tight body line throughout the entire movement.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) giant circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Maintains neutral alignment with slight upward focus during descent, then actively turns 180° with the torso during the upward phase to initiate rotation.  
Hand: Remains firmly gripped on the bar, shifting weight subtly during the turn to control the 0.5 rotation without re-grasping.  
Arm: Stays fully extended throughout, driving backward forcefully in the downswing and adjusting slightly inward during the turn for balance.  
Hip: Initiates slight arch in descent, then snaps into a tight hollow position at the bottom, lifting aggressively upward to propel the 0.5 turn.  
Leg: Stays straight and together, aiding momentum with a slight delay in the upward drive to assist rotation timing.  
Foot: Points sharply throughout, with toes leading the backward swing and helping control the final handstand alignment after the turn.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) giant circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) giant circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with slight downward rotation, then stabilizes firmly during the 0.5 turn to maintain bar control.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but adjusts rotation timing slightly to assist the turn, ensuring smooth transition into handstand.  
8-left elbow: Remains locked throughout, resisting bend even at peak swing force to preserve momentum.  
9-right elbow: Stays fully extended but subtly shifts inward during the turn to counterbalance rotation.  
12-left hip: Drives upward sharply in the hollow phase, then rotates slightly earlier than right hip to initiate turn.  
13-right hip: Delays rotation compared to left hip, creating controlled torque for the 0.5 turn.  
18-mid hip: Snaps from arched to hollow at swing bottom, then lifts aggressively to propel rotation.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors the turn, aligning with mid-hip to ensure symmetry in the final handstand.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) giant circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a backward giant swing with a precisely timed 180° mid-air rotation initiated by asymmetrical hip drive, seamlessly transitioning into a controlled handstand while maintaining rigid arm extension and minimal body arch throughout.
