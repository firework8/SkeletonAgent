Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) straddle pike jump or side split jump' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a powerful two-foot takeoff, simultaneously swinging both arms upward while driving the legs into a wide straddle or side split mid-air, achieving maximum amplitude with legs extended horizontally and toes pointed, then quickly transitions into a pike position by bringing the legs together and folding at the hips with arms reaching forward, before landing softly with feet together and arms stabilizing the body.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) straddle pike jump or side split jump' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral or slightly lifted with gaze forward, maintaining balance without excessive tilt.  
Hand: Starts palms-down near hips, then swings sharply upward in sync with takeoff, fingers extended.  
Arm: Drives forcefully upward in a straight line during takeoff, then pulls slightly inward to aid pike transition.  
Hip: Hinges sharply forward at peak height to create pike after straddle, maintaining symmetry.  
Leg: Explodes into a wide straddle (180°+) mid-air, then snaps together into pike with controlled speed.  
Foot: Points aggressively during straddle and pike, with quick ankle flexion on landing for stability.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) straddle pike jump or side split jump', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) straddle pike jump or side split jump' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates upward drive early, remains aligned with right shoulder for symmetrical arm swing.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, extends fully upward at takeoff before slight inward pull during pike.  
12-left hip: Rapidly hinges forward at peak height, maintaining 90°+ flexion in pike after straddle.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip timing but may show slight asymmetry in straddle width before pike snap.  
14-left knee: Extends fully in mid-air straddle, then sharply bends during pike transition.  
15-right knee: Synchronized with left knee but may delay flexion slightly for stylistic split emphasis.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point for straddle-to-pike transition, maintaining central balance.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes upper body alignment, preventing excessive lean during straddle phase.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) straddle pike jump or side split jump' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful upward arm drive followed by a wide mid-air straddle (180°+) with legs fully extended, then a sharp forward hip hinge into a tight pike before landing, all while maintaining strict upper-body alignment and symmetrical timing.
