Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) sheep jump (jump with upper back arch and head release with feet to head height/closed Ring)' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the sheep jump by explosively driving the legs upward while simultaneously arching the upper back and releasing the head backward, creating a pronounced curve as the feet reach head height in a closed-ring position, with the body momentarily suspended in a high, arched shape before descending into the landing phase.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) sheep jump (jump with upper back arch and head release with feet to head height/closed Ring)' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Rapidly releases backward in sync with the back arch, creating a deep curve, unlike a stag jump where the head stays neutral or slightly lifted.  
Hand: Maintains a neutral or slightly extended position, not actively reaching, unlike in a ring leap where arms often sweep upward dynamically.  
Arm: Holds a steady, slightly rounded or open position, emphasizing control rather than the wide swing seen in split jumps.  
Hip: Drives sharply upward while hyperextending backward, forming a deep arch distinct from the flatter hip line in a wolf jump.  
Leg: Extends fully upward with knees together, achieving a closed-ring shape, unlike a sheep jump with open legs where feet don’t connect.  
Foot: Points aggressively and pulls toward the head in a closed-ring position, contrasting with a stag jump where feet stay apart and lower.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) sheep jump (jump with upper back arch and head release with feet to head height/closed Ring)', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) sheep jump (jump with upper back arch and head release with feet to head height/closed Ring)' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Rapidly tilts backward in sync with the upper back arch, creating a deep curve distinct from neutral-head jumps.  
6-left shoulder: Drives upward early while rotating slightly back to aid the arched momentum, unlike flatter jumps.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in timing due to dominant-side bias.  
12-left hip: Hyperextends sharply backward as legs lift, forming the deep arch critical for the sheep jump shape.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but may delay extension if the takeoff favors one leg.  
18-mid hip: Acts as the peak of the arch, thrusting upward while the spine curves backward dynamically.  
19-thorax: Maintains extreme backward flexion throughout the jump, unlike flatter or less arched elements.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors the upper back arch, pulling slightly back as the head releases.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) sheep jump (jump with upper back arch and head release with feet to head height/closed Ring)' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The sheep jump is distinguished by its explosive upward leg drive paired with a deep, synchronized upper back arch and backward head release, forming a closed-ring shape with feet at head height, contrasting with flatter or less arched jumps like stag or wolf jumps.
