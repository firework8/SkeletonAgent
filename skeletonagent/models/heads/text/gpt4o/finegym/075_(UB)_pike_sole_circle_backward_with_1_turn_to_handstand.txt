Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a handstand on the uneven bars, then initiates a backward swing, piking sharply at the hips to bring the legs downward and forward, maintaining a tight body line as the shoulders shift backward; as the legs reach the lowest point, the gymnast extends the hips slightly to generate momentum, then whips the legs upward and backward while simultaneously rotating the shoulders 180 degrees, transitioning into a full turn as the body realigns into a handstand, finishing with controlled extension of the arms and shoulders to stabilize the final position.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral with slight backward tilt during the backward swing, then aligns with the spine during the turn to maintain balance.  
Hand: Maintains a firm grip with slight wrist flexion during the backward swing, then shifts weight dynamically during the turn to control rotation.  
Arm: Stays straight and rigid throughout, driving backward push during the swing and stabilizing during the turn to handstand.  
Hip: Sharply pikes forward at the start of the swing, then extends slightly before the turn, driving the legs upward with explosive power.  
Leg: Moves in a fast, controlled whip from piked forward to extended backward, generating momentum for the turn.  
Foot: Points aggressively throughout, with soles leading the backward circle before snapping into extension for the handstand finish.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 1 turn to handstand', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with slight depression, then rotates aggressively during the turn.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but delays rotation slightly to control the turn’s timing.  
12-left hip: Drives sharp pike early, then extends explosively to whip legs backward.  
13-right hip: Synchronizes with left but maintains tighter angle during pike for balance.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, shifting forward in pike then snapping back for rotation.  
19-thorax: Stays rigid but tilts backward early to counterbalance leg whip.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors rotation, aligning with thorax to stabilize the handstand finish.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 1 turn to handstand' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by an aggressive backward swing into a sharp pike, followed by a delayed hip extension and asymmetrical shoulder rotation driving a controlled 180° turn before snapping into a rigid handstand.
