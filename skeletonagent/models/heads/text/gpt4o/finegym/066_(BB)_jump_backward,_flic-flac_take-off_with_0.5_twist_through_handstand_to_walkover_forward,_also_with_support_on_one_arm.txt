Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) jump backward, flic-flac take-off with 0.5 twist through handstand to walkover forward, also with support on one arm' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates with a powerful backward jump off both feet, immediately transitioning into a flic-flac by arching backward with arms swinging overhead, then planting hands on the beam while driving the legs upward into a handstand with a swift 0.5 twist (180°) to face the opposite direction, followed by a controlled walkover forward as the leading leg descends and the torso lifts, all while maintaining one-arm support during the handstand and walkover phases, ensuring smooth weight transfer from hands to feet for a stable landing.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) jump backward, flic-flac take-off with 0.5 twist through handstand to walkover forward, also with support on one arm' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly backward early, then quickly rotates 180° with the twist, aligning with shoulders to maintain balance during the one-arm handstand.  
Hand: Lead hand plants firmly on the beam with fingers spread, while the second hand releases mid-twist, creating one-arm support for the walkover.  
Arm: Leading arm swings upward in the flic-flac, then extends fully in the handstand before the non-supporting arm tucks in during the twist.  
Hip: Hyperextends backward in the flic-flac, then snaps upward into the handstand while initiating the 0.5 twist before opening for the walkover.  
Leg: Back leg drives forcefully in the flic-flac, then splits asymmetrically in the walkover, with the lead leg controlling descent.  
Foot: Push-off is explosive from both feet in the backward jump, then the rear foot leads the twist before the front foot lands softly in the walkover.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) jump backward, flic-flac take-off with 0.5 twist through handstand to walkover forward, also with support on one arm', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) jump backward, flic-flac take-off with 0.5 twist through handstand to walkover forward, also with support on one arm' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward arm swing early, then drives upward asymmetrically during the 0.5 twist.  
7-right shoulder: Delays rotation slightly, then becomes the supporting side in the one-arm handstand.  
10-left wrist: Plants firmly with fingers spread during flic-flac, then releases mid-twist for one-arm transition.  
11-right wrist: Maintains strong hyperextension in the one-arm handstand while resisting twist momentum.  
12-left hip: Hyperextends sharply in flic-flac, then leads the 0.5 twist with a rapid inward rotation.  
13-right hip: Delays rotation compared to left hip, creating the asymmetrical split in the walkover.  
18-mid hip: Acts as twist axis, staying aligned until the 0.5 twist forces rapid realignment.  
20-mid shoulder: Shifts laterally during one-arm support, counterbalancing the off-center walkover descent.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) jump backward, flic-flac take-off with 0.5 twist through handstand to walkover forward, also with support on one arm' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a backward jump into a flic-flac with a sharp 0.5 twist mid-handstand, transitioning into a one-arm-supported walkover with asymmetrical hip rotation and delayed shoulder alignment.
