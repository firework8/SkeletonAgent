Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) flic-flac with step-out, also with support on one arm' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a standing position on the balance beam, then swings one leg backward into a quick backward handspring (flic-flac) with a strong push-off from both feet, rotating backward while arching slightly, transitioning to a one-arm support as the body passes vertical, then shifts weight to the supporting arm while the other arm lifts, legs split mid-air, and finally steps out with the leading leg to land upright, maintaining control as the trailing leg follows smoothly to complete the element.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) flic-flac with step-out, also with support on one arm' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly back during the backward rotation, aligning with the spine to maintain momentum, then quickly neutralizes upon step-out for balance.  
Hand: Initial double-arm swing upward, then one hand plants firmly on the beam while the other lifts early to create the one-arm support distinction.  
Arm: Leading arm drives backward for rotation, then one arm remains extended in support while the other lifts dynamically for asymmetry.  
Hip: Rapid backward arch during the flic-flac, then controlled hip alignment shifts laterally to facilitate the step-out landing.  
Leg: Split-leg action mid-flight with the leading leg driving upward early, distinguishing it from a standard flic-flac’s tucked or straight-leg form.  
Foot: Push-off is strong from both feet, but the trailing foot delays landing slightly to allow the leading foot to step out first.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) flic-flac with step-out, also with support on one arm', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) flic-flac with step-out, also with support on one arm' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives backward forcefully early in the flic-flac, then asymmetrically stabilizes as the opposite arm lifts.  
7-right shoulder: Delayed upward drive compared to left, then extends dynamically for one-arm support.  
10-left wrist: Plants firmly on the beam with slight hyperextension during one-arm support phase.  
11-right wrist: Lifts early with fingers extended, creating a clear asymmetrical line.  
12-left hip: Rapid backward arch initiates rotation, then shifts laterally to enable step-out.  
13-right hip: Maintains slight flexion mid-flight to control split-leg positioning.  
18-mid hip: Acts as the rotation pivot, arching sharply before aligning for landing.  
20-mid shoulder: Rotates asymmetrically during one-arm support, tilting toward the supporting side.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) flic-flac with step-out, also with support on one arm' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by its asymmetrical one-arm support during backward rotation, a dynamic split-leg action mid-flight, and a controlled lateral hip shift into the step-out landing, contrasting with standard flic-flacs by its delayed arm lift and deliberate weight transfer.
