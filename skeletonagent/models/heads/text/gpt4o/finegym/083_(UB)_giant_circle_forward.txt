Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) giant circle forward' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a handstand on the uneven bars, then smoothly swings forward, maintaining a straight body position as they descend in a circular motion, passing through a horizontal plane with increasing speed, before transitioning into a piked or straddled position near the bottom of the swing to generate momentum, then extending back into a straight body as they rise upward, completing the full 360-degree rotation to return to the handstand position with controlled precision.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) giant circle forward' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral and aligned with the spine throughout, avoiding excessive tilt to maintain balance during rotation.  
Hand: Maintains a firm grip on the bar, shifting pressure from palms to fingers during the downward swing for control.  
Arm: Stays straight and rigid, driving the rotation without bending, unlike in a stalder where arms bend.  
Hip: Remains extended in the first half, then slightly pikes at the bottom to generate momentum before re-extending.  
Leg: Keeps straight and pressed together until the bottom, where a slight pike differentiates it from a straight giant.  
Foot: Points continuously to streamline motion, with toes leading the upward swing to maximize swing amplitude.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) giant circle forward', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) giant circle forward' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Remains stable and slightly protracted throughout, initiating the swing with controlled rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, maintaining symmetry to prevent uneven bar contact.  
12-left hip: Extends fully in backswing, then slightly pikes at bottom for momentum before re-extending.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip precisely, ensuring symmetrical body alignment during rotation.  
18-mid hip: Controls the pike timing at the swing's lowest point, key for momentum generation.  
19-thorax: Stays rigidly aligned with shoulders and hips, preventing arching or collapsing.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors rotation, maintaining straight-arm alignment without bending like in a stalder.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) giant circle forward' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The giant circle forward is distinguished by a rigid straight-body rotation with symmetrical shoulder and hip alignment, a slight pike at the swing's bottom for momentum, and unwavering straight-arm control—unlike bent-arm stalder or arching variations.
