Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) flic-flac to land on both feet' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins by standing upright on the balance beam, then swings one leg backward while pushing off with the other, rotating backward with a quick, powerful hip extension to propel the body into a brief airborne phase, tucking slightly to maximize rotation, before extending the legs to land simultaneously on both feet with controlled precision, maintaining balance through slight knee flexion and core engagement upon impact.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) flic-flac to land on both feet' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly back early to spot the beam before snapping forward during rotation to maintain orientation.  
Hand: Starts on the beam for support, then swings backward forcefully to generate momentum before lifting off.  
Arm: Begins bent, driving upward and backward in sync with the leg swing to maximize backward rotation.  
Hip: Rapidly extends backward with a strong thrust to initiate rotation, distinguishing it from slower back handsprings.  
Leg: Leading leg swings upward and backward in a fast, straight motion while the push leg drives explosively.  
Foot: Push foot leaves the beam last, toes pointed, ensuring full extension before the backward tuck phase.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) flic-flac to land on both feet', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) flic-flac to land on both feet' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward and backward early, initiating rotation with strong asymmetrical thrust.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but delays slightly to counterbalance the leading leg swing.  
12-left hip: Rapidly hyperextends backward, creating the explosive flick motion unique to this skill.  
13-right hip: Extends forcefully but remains slightly less open than left hip for controlled rotation.  
18-mid hip: Thrusts upward sharply mid-motion, defining the inverted "flic-flac" body line.  
19-thorax: Arches backward dynamically, then snaps forward late to prepare for landing.  
20-mid shoulder: Rotates backward early, aligning with hip thrust for optimal backward propulsion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) flic-flac to land on both feet' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The flic-flac is distinguished by a rapid backward hip thrust with asymmetrical shoulder drive, explosive leg swing, and a sharp mid-air arch followed by a late forward snap into a controlled two-foot landing.
