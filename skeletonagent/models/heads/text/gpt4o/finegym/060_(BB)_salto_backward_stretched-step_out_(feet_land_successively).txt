Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) salto backward stretched-step out (feet land successively)' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the salto backward stretched by pushing off the beam with both feet, extending the body fully backward in a straight position while rotating backward, then swiftly transitions into a step-out by splitting the legs mid-air with one leg landing first followed by the other, maintaining control and alignment throughout the rotation and landing phases.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) salto backward stretched-step out (feet land successively)' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral or slightly tilted back early to initiate backward rotation, then aligns with the spine mid-flight to maintain straight posture.  
Hand: Starts on the beam for push-off, then swings upward and backward dynamically to aid rotation before stabilizing for landing.  
Arm: Extends fully upward during takeoff, then sweeps backward in sync with rotation, staying straight to enhance momentum.  
Hip: Remains fully extended throughout the salto, avoiding pike or arch, ensuring a stretched position for a clean step-out.  
Leg: Splits asymmetrically mid-rotation, with one leg driving forward and the other back, distinguishing it from a tucked or piked salto.  
Foot: Lands successively, with the leading foot touching first, followed by the trailing foot, ensuring controlled balance on the beam.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) salto backward stretched-step out (feet land successively)', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) salto backward stretched-step out (feet land successively)' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates upward drive early, remains open during rotation to maintain stretched alignment.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but may delay slightly during step-out to control asymmetrical landing.  
12-left hip: Extends fully backward at takeoff, stays rigid to prevent pike, then splits forward mid-air.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip extension but drives backward in step-out, creating split asymmetry.  
14-left knee: Straightens completely at launch, bends slightly only on landing for absorption.  
15-right knee: Mirrors left knee but delays bend to allow trailing leg extension in step-out.  
18-mid hip: Maintains backward rotation axis, remains aligned between hips to prevent arching.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors arm swing momentum, stays elevated to counterbalance leg split.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) salto backward stretched-step out (feet land successively)' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is recognized by its fully stretched backward rotation with no pike, followed by an asymmetrical mid-air leg split and successive one-foot-at-a-time landing, requiring rigid hip extension and controlled shoulder-driven momentum throughout.
