Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1 turn off' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a powerful sprint into a round-off (VT), planting hands sideways while the legs swing over to transition into a backward flic-flac, where the body rebounds dynamically with legs driving backward and arms thrusting upward, immediately propelling into a stretched salto backward with a precise 1-turn rotation, maintaining full extension throughout the flight phase before landing firmly with controlled deceleration.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1 turn off' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tucks slightly forward in the round-off, then snaps backward sharply in the flic-flac to initiate backward rotation.  
Hand: Plants sideways in the round-off with fingers spread, then thrusts upward aggressively in the flic-flac to maximize backward momentum.  
Arm: Swings dynamically from a bent position in the round-off to fully extended overhead in the flic-flac, driving backward rotation.  
Hip: Extends fully during the round-off leg swing, then hyperextends in the flic-flac rebound to amplify backward salto power.  
Leg: Kicks forcefully backward in the flic-flac with straight knees, maintaining symmetry to ensure a clean, stretched salto.  
Foot: Pushes explosively off the ground in the flic-flac with pointed toes, then stays fully extended throughout the backward salto rotation.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1 turn off', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1 turn off' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward explosively in flic-flac, extending beyond 120° to maximize backward rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but with slight delay to control salto entry, maintaining symmetry.  
12-left hip: Hyperextends sharply in flic-flac rebound, generating power for the stretched salto.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but stays tighter during the 1-turn rotation for stability.  
18-mid hip: Thrusts forward early in round-off, then snaps backward in flic-flac for rotation.  
19-thorax: Holds rigid alignment during salto, slightly arched to maintain stretched position.  
20-mid shoulder: Leads the 1-turn rotation with a controlled tilt, ensuring clean axis.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward with 1 turn off' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by its explosive backward flic-flac rebound with hyperextended hips, a rigidly stretched salto with a precisely timed 1-turn rotation, and symmetrical shoulder thrusts driving the backward momentum while maintaining full-body extension throughout flight.
