Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) salto backward stretched with legs together' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the backward salto by swinging the arms upward and pushing off the floor with both legs simultaneously, rotating backward with a fully extended body and legs tightly together, maintaining a stretched position throughout the rotation until landing upright with controlled deceleration, ensuring smooth transitions between takeoff, flight, and landing phases.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) salto backward stretched with legs together' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral or slightly tilted back early to initiate backward rotation, maintaining alignment with the spine throughout.  
Hand: Starts palms-down near hips, swings upward forcefully at takeoff, then stays extended and aligned with arms in flight.  
Arm: Begins slightly bent, extends fully upward during takeoff for momentum, then stays straight and symmetrical in flight.  
Hip: Remains fully extended with no flexion, driving backward rotation while keeping a straight body line.  
Leg: Stays completely straight and pressed together from takeoff to landing, ensuring no split or bend.  
Foot: Points sharply at takeoff, remains extended in flight, and absorbs landing with a controlled toe-heel sequence.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) salto backward stretched with legs together', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) salto backward stretched with legs together' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates upward drive early, stays aligned with right shoulder for symmetrical rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, extends fully upward at takeoff to maximize backward momentum.  
12-left hip: Remains rigidly extended, no flexion during rotation to maintain straight body line.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip, stays locked in full extension to prevent pike or arch deviations.  
14-left knee: Holds complete extension throughout, no bend even during landing absorption.  
15-right knee: Keeps identical straight alignment with left knee, ensuring no leg separation.  
18-mid hip: Acts as rotation axis, stays centered with no lateral tilt during flight.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors arm symmetry, drives equal upward force for balanced takeoff.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) salto backward stretched with legs together' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
A perfectly straight, fully extended backward salto with locked hips and knees, symmetrical shoulder drive, and no arch or pike distinguishes this element from tucked or piked variations.
