Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) free aerial cartwheel landing in cross position' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a powerful takeoff from one leg, swinging the free leg upward and backward while simultaneously driving the arms forward and upward, initiating a dynamic rotation sideways; as the body reaches peak height, the legs split widely in a vertical plane with the lead leg extending forward and the trailing leg backward, while the torso remains upright and the arms stretch outward for balance; during descent, the gymnast shifts weight smoothly onto the landing leg, bending the knee slightly to absorb impact, while the free leg lowers gracefully into a crossed position behind or beside the supporting leg, and the arms adjust to stabilize the finish, completing the element with controlled precision.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) free aerial cartwheel landing in cross position' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral or slightly tilted upward, tracking the rotation to maintain balance, unlike in a standard aerial where it may tuck forward.  
Hand: Starts palm-down during takeoff, then opens wide for stability mid-air, contrasting with a cartwheel where hands contact the beam.  
Arm: Sweeps upward dynamically in takeoff, then extends sideways for balance mid-flight, differing from a side aerial where arms may stay closer to the body.  
Hip: Drives upward explosively in takeoff, then rotates sideways with controlled symmetry, unlike a back handspring where hips thrust backward.  
Leg: Lead leg swings forward in a high split mid-air, while the trailing leg extends backward, creating a wider split than in a round-off.  
Foot: Landing foot points slightly outward on impact, while the free foot crosses neatly behind, distinguishing it from a stag-legged aerial.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) free aerial cartwheel landing in cross position', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) free aerial cartwheel landing in cross position' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates upward drive early, rotates sideways with controlled asymmetry compared to standard cartwheel.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but delays slightly to counterbalance the split-leg position mid-air.  
12-left hip: Thrusts upward explosively on takeoff, then opens laterally to maximize split amplitude.  
13-right hip: Extends backward with precision, maintaining a straighter line than in a side aerial.  
16-left ankle: Flexes sharply at landing to absorb impact while keeping toes pointed outward.  
17-right ankle: Holds pointed position longer, crossing neatly behind left foot for stability.  
18-mid hip: Rotates cleanly in the transverse plane, avoiding excessive tilt seen in stag aerials.  
20-mid shoulder: Stays aligned over hips mid-flight, preventing excessive lean like in off-axis variations.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) free aerial cartwheel landing in cross position' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful sideways rotation with a high, symmetrical split mid-air, controlled shoulder-driven momentum, and a precise cross-legged landing where the free foot tucks neatly behind the supporting leg without stag or pike adjustments.
