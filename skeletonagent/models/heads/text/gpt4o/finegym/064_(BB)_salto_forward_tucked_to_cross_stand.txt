Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) salto forward tucked to cross stand' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates a forward salto by swinging the arms upward and jumping off both feet, tucking the knees tightly to the chest while rotating forward in a high, compact somersault, then extends the legs downward and opens the tuck to land smoothly in a cross stand with arms raised for balance, maintaining control throughout the flight and landing phases.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) salto forward tucked to cross stand' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tucks forward early with chin slightly tucked to initiate rotation, maintaining neutral alignment until landing.  
Hand: Starts palms-down, swings upward forcefully to generate lift, then opens wide for balance in the cross stand.  
Arm: Drives upward in sync with the jump, pulls inward to tighten the tuck, then extends laterally for landing stability.  
Hip: Flexes sharply at takeoff to create forward rotation, stays compact in mid-air, then extends fully before landing.  
Leg: Knees pull tightly to chest in a fast tuck, maintaining symmetry, then snap open late for a controlled cross stand.  
Foot: Pushes explosively off the beam, toes pointed during flight, then lands with one foot crossed precisely over the other.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) salto forward tucked to cross stand', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) salto forward tucked to cross stand' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward sharply at takeoff, then pulls inward to tighten tuck, maintaining symmetry with right.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may lead slightly in rotation to control cross stand landing.  
12-left hip: Flexes rapidly to initiate forward rotation, tucking knee tightly to chest mid-flight.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip flexion but delays extension slightly to stabilize cross stand landing.  
14-left knee: Pulls aggressively toward chest in tuck, maintaining 90°+ bend until late extension.  
15-right knee: Synced with left knee but may open marginally later to ensure precise foot crossing.  
18-mid hip: Acts as rotation axis, staying compact during tuck before extending for landing alignment.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors arm swing for lift, then shifts laterally to balance cross stand posture.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) salto forward tucked to cross stand' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful upward arm drive into a symmetrical forward tuck, rapid hip flexion for tight rotation, and a delayed knee extension leading into a precise cross-stand landing with controlled shoulder alignment.
