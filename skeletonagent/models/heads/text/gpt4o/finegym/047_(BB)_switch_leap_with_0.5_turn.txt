Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) switch leap with 0.5 turn' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a slight forward lean, swinging the dominant leg upward while pushing off the beam with both feet, initiating a 0.5 turn (180°) during the ascent; the arms drive upward to aid rotation as the body reaches peak height, with the non-dominant leg swiftly switching positions mid-air to lead the descent, landing smoothly on the beam in a controlled, slightly flexed stance, completing the turn with precise alignment and balance.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) switch leap with 0.5 turn' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral with gaze forward early, then slightly tilts toward rotation direction during the 0.5 turn to maintain balance.  
Hand: Fingers stay extended, palms turn inward slightly during arm swing to generate rotational momentum.  
Arm: Sweeps upward asymmetrically—lead arm drives higher to initiate turn, while trailing arm stabilizes mid-air.  
Hip: Opens sharply at takeoff to allow leg switch, then levels during rotation to maintain axis control.  
Leg: Front leg lifts straight (180°) at takeoff, then swiftly switches with rear leg mid-air for split symmetry.  
Foot: Push-off foot points aggressively during takeoff, while landing foot flexes early to absorb impact quietly.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) switch leap with 0.5 turn', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) switch leap with 0.5 turn' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward asymmetrically early to initiate rotation, reaching near-vertical before peak height.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes mid-turn, slightly lagging behind the left to control rotational speed.  
12-left hip: Opens sharply at takeoff, then levels mid-air to allow the leg switch.  
13-right hip: Delayed extension compared to left hip, ensuring split symmetry during flight.  
16-left ankle: Aggressive plantar flexion at takeoff, then dorsiflexes early for quiet landing.  
17-right ankle: Maintains slight flexion during flight, then aligns with left ankle upon landing.  
18-mid hip: Rotates precisely 180° with minimal lateral tilt to maintain beam alignment.  
20-mid shoulder: Leads upper-body rotation, staying aligned with hips for controlled turn.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) switch leap with 0.5 turn' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is recognized by its sharp initial hip opening, asymmetrical shoulder-driven 180° rotation, mid-air leg switch with precise split symmetry, and controlled landing with aligned upper and lower body.
