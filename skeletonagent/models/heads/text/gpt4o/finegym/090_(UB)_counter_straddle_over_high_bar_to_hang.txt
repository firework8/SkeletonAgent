Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) counter straddle over high bar to hang' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a front support on the high bar, swings backward with straight arms and a slight pike, then dynamically extends the hips upward while releasing the bar, rotates backward with the body fully extended in a straddle position, clears the bar with legs wide apart, regrasps the bar with hands shoulder-width apart, and transitions smoothly into a straight-arm hang with the body momentarily in a slight arch before settling into a controlled hang.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) counter straddle over high bar to hang' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly lifted with chin neutral early, then tilts back during backward rotation to spot the bar before regrasp.  
Hand: Releases the bar at peak backward swing, regrasps with quick, symmetrical shoulder-width grip after straddle clearance.  
Arm: Remains straight and rigid throughout swing, extends fully upward during straddle rotation to maximize height.  
Hip: Drives sharply upward in a pike before straddle, then opens fully mid-rotation for maximum clearance over the bar.  
Leg: Straddles wide (near 180°) symmetrically during rotation, then snaps together late to avoid bar contact.  
Foot: Points toes dynamically during swing, maintains active extension in straddle for clean bar clearance.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) counter straddle over high bar to hang', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) counter straddle over high bar to hang' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with slight depression, then lifts sharply upward during straddle rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in timing during regrasp.  
12-left hip: Drives upward explosively in early pike, then opens wide (near 150°) during straddle.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but delays closing slightly to ensure clean bar clearance.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, thrusting forward in swing then extending fully mid-rotation.  
20-mid shoulder: Maintains rigid alignment with arms, shifts backward late to control regrasp.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) counter straddle over high bar to hang' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful backward swing leading into an explosive upward hip thrust, a wide straddle rotation with full-body extension, and a late regrasp after clearing the bar, contrasting with similar moves by its delayed leg closure and rigid shoulder alignment throughout.
