Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) split ring jump (ring jump with front leg horizontal to the floor)' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins by standing upright, then swings the front leg forward and upward to reach a horizontal position while simultaneously pushing off the ground with the back leg, propelling the body upward into a split; the arms swing dynamically upward for momentum as the torso remains upright, then the front leg lowers while the back leg drives forward to meet it mid-air, creating a split ring shape before both legs swiftly reunite and absorb the landing with a slight knee bend, maintaining balance.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) split ring jump (ring jump with front leg horizontal to the floor)' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright with neutral alignment, slightly lifted chin to maintain balance, contrasting with tucked-head variations.  
Hand: Fingers extended and taut, palms face inward early, then rotate slightly outward during the jump for stability.  
Arm: Sweeps upward dynamically in sync with the front leg lift, elbows straight but not locked, aiding propulsion.  
Hip: Stays square and level during takeoff, then rotates minimally to allow the front leg’s horizontal split position.  
Leg: Front leg lifts sharply to horizontal with a straight knee, while the back leg drives upward in a split, forming the ring shape.  
Foot: Front foot points aggressively to maintain line, back foot flexes slightly at peak height to emphasize ring contrast.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) split ring jump (ring jump with front leg horizontal to the floor)', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) split ring jump (ring jump with front leg horizontal to the floor)' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates upward arm swing early, remains open and lifted to stabilize the split ring position.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but may delay slightly if front leg is right, aiding asymmetrical propulsion.  
12-left hip: Drives back leg upward explosively, maintaining near-180° split with controlled rotation.  
13-right hip: Holds front leg horizontally, resisting downward pull to emphasize ring shape.  
14-left knee: Extends fully in back leg during peak height, contrasting bent-knee variations.  
15-right knee: Locks straight as front leg lifts, creating sharp horizontal line at 90°+ to torso.  
18-mid hip: Stays centered but tilts minimally forward to counterbalance the split momentum.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors arm motion, aligning symmetrically to prevent excessive torso lean.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) split ring jump (ring jump with front leg horizontal to the floor)' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a sharp horizontal front leg with locked knee, explosive back-leg drive into a near-180° split, upright torso with minimal hip rotation, and symmetrical shoulder-arm motion ensuring balance during the dynamic ring-shaped mid-air position.
