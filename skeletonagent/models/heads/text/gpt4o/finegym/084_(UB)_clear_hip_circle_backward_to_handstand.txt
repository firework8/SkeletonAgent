Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) clear hip circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a front support on the uneven bars, swings the legs backward with a slight pike, then aggressively extends the hips upward and backward while maintaining shoulder pressure, allowing the body to rotate around the bar in a backward circle; as the hips rise, the gymnast shifts the shoulders forward, opens the body into a fully extended position, and finishes in a vertical handstand with arms straight, legs together, and body aligned.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) clear hip circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: The head remains neutral or slightly lifted early, then tucks slightly as hips rise, before extending back to neutral in the handstand for balance.  
Hand: The hands maintain a firm grip, shifting pressure from heels to fingertips as the body rotates backward around the bar.  
Arm: The arms stay straight throughout, resisting flexion to control rotation and provide a rigid lever for the backward swing.  
Hip: The hips initiate with a slight pike, then explosively extend backward and upward, driving the rotation into the handstand.  
Leg: The legs swing back in unison, straightening fully after the hip extension to create a long, tight line in the handstand.  
Foot: The feet point sharply from the backward swing through the extension, emphasizing amplitude and control into the handstand.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) clear hip circle backward to handstand', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) clear hip circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward rotation with slight depression, then shifts forward aggressively as hips rise.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but must maintain perfect symmetry to avoid twisting.  
12-left hip: Drives explosive backward extension with a sharp, high-amplitude thrust.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip precisely, ensuring equal power for a straight handstand.  
18-mid hip: Controls the pike-to-extension transition, timing the backward whip motion.  
19-thorax: Stays rigid during rotation, then opens fully to align vertically in handstand.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors the swing, resisting collapse as body rotates backward.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) clear hip circle backward to handstand' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The clear hip circle backward to handstand is distinguished by a powerful backward hip extension driving rotation, strict shoulder stability, and a seamless transition from pike to full-body extension into a vertical handstand without pauses or asymmetry.
