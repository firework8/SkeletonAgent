Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) double salto backward tucked' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the (FX) double salto backward tucked by forcefully pushing off the floor with both feet, swinging the arms upward to generate momentum, then tucking the knees tightly to the chest while rotating backward in a high, fast double somersault, maintaining a compact tucked position throughout the rotation before extending the legs and arms to prepare for a controlled landing on the feet with the body upright.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) double salto backward tucked' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly back early to spot rotation, then neutral to maintain alignment during tuck.  
Hand: Starts palms-down pushing the floor, then swings upward sharply to initiate backward momentum.  
Arm: Extends fully upward at takeoff, then pulls inward quickly to tighten the tuck rotation.  
Hip: Flexes aggressively at peak height to create a tight tuck, enhancing rotational speed.  
Leg: Knees drive upward and tuck tightly to chest, reducing moment of inertia for faster flips.  
Foot: Points toes during push-off, then flexes slightly in tuck before extending for landing.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) double salto backward tucked', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) double salto backward tucked' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward sharply at takeoff, then pulls inward asymmetrically to tighten rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but with slight delay, ensuring symmetrical backward momentum.  
12-left hip: Flexes aggressively mid-air, tucking knee to chest faster than right for rotation control.  
13-right hip: Follows left hip but maintains tighter angle to balance rotation speed.  
14-left knee: Snaps to chest immediately after takeoff, creating compact tuck for faster flip.  
15-right knee: Matches left knee timing but stays slightly less bent to stabilize landing.  
18-mid hip: Initiates backward rotation early, maintaining forward lean longer than single saltos.  
20-mid shoulder: Extends fully upward at launch, then drops faster than hips to drive rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) double salto backward tucked' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The double salto backward tucked is distinguished by an explosive upward arm drive, an aggressive hip tuck with knees tightly pulled to the chest, and a rapid double backward rotation initiated by sharp shoulder retraction, maintaining a compact posture longer than single saltos for faster flips.
