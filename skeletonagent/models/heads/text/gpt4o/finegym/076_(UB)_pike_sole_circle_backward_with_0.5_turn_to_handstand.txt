Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a handstand on the uneven bars, then smoothly lowers the legs into a pike position while initiating a backward rotation, maintaining tight body alignment as the hips flex to approximately 90 degrees; the legs then swing downward in a controlled arc, passing through the vertical as the shoulders open and the arms remain straight, while the body simultaneously executes a 180-degree turn around the longitudinal axis, transitioning seamlessly back into a handstand with precise timing, full amplitude, and minimal deviation from the intended path.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral with slight backward tilt during the pike phase, then actively rotates 180° with the turn, aligning with the spine to control rotation.  
Hand: Maintains a firm grip on the bar, shifting pressure slightly during the turn to guide momentum without releasing.  
Arm: Stays straight and rigid throughout, providing stability while allowing controlled shoulder rotation during the turn.  
Hip: Flexes sharply to 90° in the initial pike, then extends dynamically during the backward swing, driving the turn.  
Leg: Moves in a controlled downward arc from the pike, staying straight and symmetrical, aiding rotation with precise timing.  
Foot: Points aggressively throughout, with the soles leading the backward circle before snapping into alignment for the handstand.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward rotation early, remains stable while allowing controlled shoulder opening during the turn.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but subtly adjusts pressure to guide the 0.5 turn.  
12-left hip: Flexes sharply to 90° in pike, then extends dynamically to drive backward swing.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but delays extension slightly to assist rotation.  
18-mid hip: Maintains midline control, ensuring symmetrical pike and precise turn timing.  
19-thorax: Rotates 180° with rigid alignment, preventing lateral deviation.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors the turn, stabilizing as arms stay straight throughout.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) pike sole circle backward with 0.5 turn to handstand' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a sharp pike-to-backward-swing transition with a precisely timed 180° mid-air rotation, rigid shoulder stability, and aggressive hip extension driving the turn while maintaining straight arms and pointed feet throughout the motion.
