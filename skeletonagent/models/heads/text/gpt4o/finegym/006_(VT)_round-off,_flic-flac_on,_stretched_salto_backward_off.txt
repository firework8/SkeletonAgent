Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward off' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the round-off with a powerful hurdle step, transitioning into a forward handspring motion where the hands contact the vaulting table while the legs swing upward in a split, then forcefully rebound off the hands as the body rotates 180 degrees to face backward, immediately flowing into the flic-flac (back handspring) by pushing through the shoulders and arching backward with dynamic leg drive, culminating in a backward salto where the body fully extends, tucking or maintaining layout position mid-flight, and finally landing upright with controlled amplitude and precise timing.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward off' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly back during round-off, snaps forward in flic-flac to initiate backward rotation, then remains neutral in salto for control.  
Hand: Contacts vault in round-off with quick rebound, palms push explosively in flic-flac for backward momentum, then tucks or opens in salto.  
Arm: Extends fully in round-off block, swings dynamically upward in flic-flac, then either tightens (tuck) or extends (layout) in salto.  
Hip: Drives upward in round-off, hyperextends slightly in flic-flac for backward thrust, then fully extends in stretched salto.  
Leg: Splits sharply in round-off, whips powerfully in flic-flac to propel rotation, then straightens fully in salto for amplitude.  
Foot: Pushes off toes in round-off, snaps to rebound in flic-flac, then points rigidly in salto for clean landing.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward off', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward off' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward sharply in round-off, initiates early rotation for flic-flac, asymmetrically extends in salto.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left but delays slightly in round-off, then matches force for backward salto alignment.  
12-left hip: Hyperextends in flic-flac for backward thrust, remains rigid in salto for stretched position.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but with tighter rotation control to prevent over-rotation.  
18-mid hip: Pivots explosively in round-off, maintains midline stability during flic-flac and salto.  
19-thorax: Arches dynamically in flic-flac, then fully straightens in salto for maximum amplitude.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns with thorax in flic-flac, stabilizes rotation axis during backward salto.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(VT) round-off, flic-flac on, stretched salto backward off' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful round-off into a dynamic flic-flac with deep shoulder and hip hyperextension, transitioning into a fully stretched backward salto with rigid midline control and delayed rotation.
