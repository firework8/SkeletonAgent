Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) giant circle backward' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a handstand on the uneven bars, then initiates a backward swing by slightly piking at the hips, allowing the body to descend in a controlled arc while maintaining straight arms; as the body passes under the bar, the hips extend to generate momentum, and the legs drive upward and backward in a wide, circular motion, with the shoulders opening fully as the body rises back toward the handstand position, completing the giant circle with a seamless transition into the inverted finish.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) giant circle backward' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral or slightly tilted back, tracking the motion to maintain balance, unlike in a forward giant where it may tuck forward.  
Hand: Maintains a firm grip with wrists straight, rotating around the bar in sync with the body's backward swing.  
Arm: Stays fully extended throughout, resisting flexion unlike in a stalder where arms may bend.  
Hip: Slightly pikes early in the descent, then extends aggressively under the bar to drive momentum upward.  
Leg: Sweeps in a wide, controlled arc, staying straight and together to maximize swing, unlike in a toe-on where legs may split.  
Foot: Points sharply throughout, aiding in momentum and line, contrasting with flexed feet in some backward swings.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) giant circle backward', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) giant circle backward' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward rotation early, remains stable with minimal elevation to maintain straight-arm swing.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in timing during hand transitions.  
12-left hip: Drives initial pike sharply at ~45° before full extension under the bar for momentum.  
13-right hip: Extends slightly later than left hip to enhance whip-like motion in the downswing.  
18-mid hip: Controls overall body line, shifting from pike to hyperextension during upswing.  
19-thorax: Maintains rigid alignment, resisting arch until peak height to prevent early hollowing.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors rotation, delaying slight backward tilt until handstand recovery phase.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) giant circle backward' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The backward giant circle is distinguished by its straight-arm rotation, aggressive hip pike-to-extension timing under the bar, and rigid thorax alignment, creating a smooth, wide arc without the bent-arm or leg-split variations seen in stalder or toe-on skills.
