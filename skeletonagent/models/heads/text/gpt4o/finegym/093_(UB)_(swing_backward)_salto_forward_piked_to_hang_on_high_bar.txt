Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) (swing backward) salto forward piked to hang on high bar' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins from a handstand on the high bar, swings backward with straight arms and a slight arch, then aggressively pikes at the hips as the body passes vertical, generating rotation forward; the legs whip upward while the shoulders pull back, creating a tight pike position before extending slightly to regrasp the bar in a hang position as the swing transitions into the next movement.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) (swing backward) salto forward piked to hang on high bar' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted back early in the backward swing, then tucks sharply forward as the pike initiates to enhance forward rotation.  
Hand: Maintains a firm grip throughout, releasing only briefly during the salto before regrasping with symmetrical timing.  
Arm: Stays straight during the backward swing, then bends slightly during the pike to aid rotation before re-extending for the catch.  
Hip: Flexes aggressively at the peak of the backward swing, creating a sharp pike angle (≤90°) to drive the forward salto.  
Leg: Extends straight in the backward swing, then whips upward in a rapid, symmetrical motion to maximize rotational speed.  
Foot: Points continuously until pike initiation, then flexes slightly during the salto before re-pointing for the regrasp.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) (swing backward) salto forward piked to hang on high bar', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) (swing backward) salto forward piked to hang on high bar' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with slight hyperextension, then sharply flexes during pike to drive rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in regrasp timing for balance.  
12-left hip: Aggressively flexes (≤90°) at peak backward swing, creating tight pike for forward salto.  
13-right hip: Synchronized with left hip but may flex marginally less to fine-tune rotation speed.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, rapidly shifting from slight arch to extreme pike for rotational impulse.  
20-mid shoulder: Maintains alignment until pike, then pulls backward to counterbalance leg whip.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) (swing backward) salto forward piked to hang on high bar' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful backward swing transitioning into an aggressive forward pike with sharp hip flexion (≤90°), synchronized shoulder pull-back, and a rapid leg whip—creating a tight rotational burst before regrasping the bar in a controlled hang.
