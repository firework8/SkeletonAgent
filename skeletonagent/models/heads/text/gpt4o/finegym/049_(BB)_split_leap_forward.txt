Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(BB) split leap forward' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a powerful forward run, transitions into a dynamic hurdle step with arms swinging upward, then explosively pushes off the leading leg while simultaneously swinging the back leg upward into a full split mid-air, achieving maximum amplitude with legs extended horizontally in opposite directions and torso upright, before smoothly landing on the leading leg with the trailing leg descending gracefully to complete the movement.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(BB) split leap forward' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright and neutral with gaze forward, ensuring balance and control throughout the leap.  
Hand: Palms face inward early, then extend outward during flight to enhance stability and aesthetic line.  
Arm: Sweeps upward dynamically in unison with the leading leg, reaching full extension at peak split for maximum amplitude.  
Hip: Opens fully at the peak of the leap, maintaining square alignment to emphasize split symmetry.  
Leg: Front leg lifts sharply to horizontal while the back leg drives upward with equal height, creating a perfect 180° split.  
Foot: Leading foot points aggressively during takeoff, while the back foot maintains pointed tension throughout the split.

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(BB) split leap forward', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(BB) split leap forward' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates upward drive early, extends fully at peak split to enhance amplitude.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight delay in backward arm sweep for balance.  
12-left hip: Opens sharply to 180° at peak leap, maintains square alignment longer than typical jumps.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but with controlled asymmetry to stabilize landing momentum.  
14-left knee: Extends fully mid-flight, hyperextends slightly to emphasize split line.  
15-right knee: Delays full extension until peak height, creating dynamic split timing.  
18-mid hip: Rotates minimally, stays aligned with thorax to ensure clean split form.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors arm motion, remains stable while arms adjust for balance.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(BB) split leap forward' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The split leap forward is distinguished by explosive upward shoulder drive, precise 180° hip opening at peak height, delayed knee extension for dynamic split timing, and minimal mid-hip rotation while maintaining strict square alignment throughout flight.
