Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) switch leap with 1 turn' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins with a powerful forward hurdle step, swinging the leading leg upward while the trailing leg pushes off the floor, simultaneously rotating the torso 180 degrees mid-air to switch legs, achieving a split position with the new leading leg extended high and the rear leg lowered, then lands on the original trailing leg with controlled balance, completing a full 360-degree turn by the time both feet touch the ground.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) switch leap with 1 turn' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral or slightly lifted, tracking rotation to maintain balance during the 180° turn.  
Hand: Arms extend sideways at shoulder height, aiding rotation control and symmetry, unlike relaxed arms in basic leaps.  
Arm: Sweeps dynamically upward in unison with the leading leg, driving the turn before stabilizing in a T-position.  
Hip: Rotates sharply 180° mid-air to switch split positions, ensuring full turn completion before landing.  
Leg: Front leg lifts high in split while back leg extends downward, switching roles mid-flight for a clean split change.  
Foot: Leading foot points aggressively during lift, while trailing foot pushes forcefully off the floor to initiate rotation.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) switch leap with 1 turn', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) switch leap with 1 turn' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward with leading arm, initiating rotation before stabilizing in a T-position.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but delays slightly to control turn timing.  
12-left hip: Rotates sharply 180° mid-air, lifting left leg into split before switching.  
13-right hip: Extends backward early, then snaps forward to complete the split switch.  
14-left knee: Extends fully during initial leap, then bends slightly for landing control.  
15-right knee: Remains straight during push-off, then flexes mid-air for split transition.  
18-mid hip: Acts as rotation axis, maintaining alignment until full turn completion.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes upper body, preventing excessive lean during the turn.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) switch leap with 1 turn' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a sharp 180° mid-air hip rotation during a split leap, synchronized with a controlled shoulder-driven turn, precise split-leg switching, and an upright torso posture maintained throughout the full rotation.
