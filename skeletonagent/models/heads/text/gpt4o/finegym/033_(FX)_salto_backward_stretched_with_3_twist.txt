Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) salto backward stretched with 3 twist' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates a powerful backward salto with a fully stretched body, generating momentum from a strong push-off and backward swing of the arms, then rapidly rotates backward while simultaneously executing three tight, consecutive twists around the longitudinal axis by sharply pulling the arms inward and tilting the head and shoulders, maintaining full body extension throughout the flight phase before spotting the landing and absorbing impact with a controlled, slightly bent-knee finish.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) salto backward stretched with 3 twist' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Snaps sharply to the side at takeoff to initiate the first twist, then remains aligned with the twist rotation, contrasting with slower head motions in single-twist saltos.  
Hand: Starts open and extended, then pulls inward asymmetrically (one hand leading) to accelerate the twist, unlike symmetrical arm motions in non-twisting saltos.  
Arm: Swings backward forcefully at takeoff, then tucks tightly into the chest to increase twist speed, differing from open-arm positions in layout saltos.  
Hip: Maintains full extension throughout, driving upward in a straight line to preserve backward rotation, unlike piked or tucked variations.  
Leg: Stays straight and pressed together from takeoff to landing, ensuring clean twist alignment, unlike bent-leg twists.  
Foot: Points aggressively at takeoff, then remains aligned with the legs during twists, unlike relaxed foot positions in simpler saltos.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) salto backward stretched with 3 twist', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) salto backward stretched with 3 twist' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Aligns with thorax during rotation but tilts sharply sideways at twist initiation.  
6-left shoulder: Drives upward early with strong backward swing, then tucks inward asymmetrically to accelerate twist.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but with slight delay to create twisting torque.  
12-left hip: Maintains full extension throughout, rotating backward with minimal lateral deviation.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip but shows subtle inward tilt during mid-twist for stability.  
18-mid hip: Stays vertically aligned during flight, preventing pike or arch that would slow rotation.  
19-thorax: Remains rigidly extended, transferring twist momentum from shoulders to hips.  
20-mid shoulder: Rotates cleanly around longitudinal axis without lateral sway, distinguishing from single-twist saltos.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) salto backward stretched with 3 twist' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a fully extended backward salto with precisely timed triple-twist initiation from a sharp head tilt and asymmetrical arm tuck, maintaining rigid hip and thorax alignment throughout rotation without pike or arch deviations.
