Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(FX) double salto backward stretched' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast initiates the (FX) double salto backward stretched by powerfully driving the arms upward and backward while pushing explosively off both feet into a backward rotation, maintaining a fully extended body position with tight core and pointed toes throughout the initial backward somersault, then seamlessly transitioning into the second rotation with continued backward momentum, precisely controlling the amplitude and speed to ensure a clean, controlled landing on the feet with the chest upright and arms stabilizing the finish.

Round 2 Question:
For the '(FX) double salto backward stretched' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Neutral alignment early, tilts slightly backward with rotation initiation to enhance backward momentum while maintaining focus for spatial awareness.  
Hand: Palms face backward during takeoff, driving upward then sweeping close to the body in a tight backward circle to maximize rotation speed.  
Arm: Fully extended upward at takeoff, then pulls sharply backward and inward in sync with rotation, maintaining symmetry for a stretched position.  
Hip: Remains fully extended with no pike, driving backward in a straight line to preserve the stretched silhouette, contrasting with tucked or piked saltos.  
Leg: Explosively extends at takeoff, stays straight and pressed together throughout both rotations, ensuring minimal air resistance for faster spin.  
Foot: Points aggressively from takeoff through landing, with ankles locked to maintain rigidity, aiding height and rotation control in the stretched position.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(FX) double salto backward stretched', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(FX) double salto backward stretched' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward and backward explosively at takeoff, maintaining full extension to maximize rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder precisely, ensuring symmetrical backward arm sweep for a stretched salto.  
12-left hip: Remains fully extended with no flexion, aligning straight with the torso throughout both rotations.  
13-right hip: Matches left hip in rigidity, preventing any pike to distinguish from tucked/piked variations.  
18-mid hip: Anchors backward rotation, staying aligned with thorax to maintain a straight body line.  
19-thorax: Holds a tight, extended posture, delaying any arch to preserve the stretched form.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates with arms for synchronized backward pull, critical for rotation speed and control.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(FX) double salto backward stretched' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
The double salto backward stretched is distinguished by its rigid, fully extended body line, explosive symmetrical backward arm drive, and unwavering hip-thorax alignment throughout both rotations, contrasting with tucked or piked variations.
