Round 1 Question:
Describe in full detail the movement of the human body during the '(UB) (swing backward or front support) salto forward straddled to hang on high bar' gymnastics element in one sentence.
Focus specifically on the timing, direction, amplitude, and transitions of body parts.
Highlight how the action unfolds from start to finish.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The gymnast begins in a front support on the high bar, swings backward with legs together, then initiates a powerful forward salto by sharply piking and straddling the legs while releasing the bar, rotating forward with extended arms and open hips to regrasp the bar in a hang position, completing the movement with controlled momentum and body alignment.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
For the '(UB) (swing backward or front support) salto forward straddled to hang on high bar' gymnastics element, give a precise and brief description of how each of the following body parts moves: head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Focus on posture, timing, rotation, and symmetry.
Mention how the motion of each part helps distinguish this element from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Include directional terms (e.g., forward, upward), angles (e.g., bent at 90°), or timing cues (e.g., early lift, delayed landing)
6. Focus on what makes the motion unique in contrast to visually similar actions
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tucks slightly forward early in the swing, then lifts sharply backward to initiate rotation during the salto.  
Hand: Maintains a tight grip until release, then regrasps the bar with palms facing forward after full rotation.  
Arm: Extends fully during backswing, bends slightly before release, then whips forward to aid rotation.  
Hip: Drives upward in a quick pike at peak of backswing, then opens fully mid-salto for straddle position.  
Leg: Stays straight in backswing, then splits wide in straddle with toes pointed during forward rotation.  
Foot: Points backward in initial swing, then snaps upward in straddle with outward rotation for momentum.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
We represent the human body with 20 joints labeled:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the full-body motion of '(UB) (swing backward or front support) salto forward straddled to hang on high bar', list the joints that are most critical to distinguish this element from other similar elements in the same set.
Include both sides (left/right) when relevant.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
Now describe the fine-grained motion or alignment of the critical joints listed above during the '(UB) (swing backward or front support) salto forward straddled to hang on high bar' gymnastics element.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One line per joint, no blank lines
3. Order by joint number
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important joints for distinguishing this element
6. Include temporal cues (e.g., 'initiates early', 'holds position longer'), angular features (e.g., 'extends beyond 120°'), or asymmetries
7. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Initiates backward swing with slight hyperextension, then drives sharply upward during salto release.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder but may show slight asymmetry in force during straddle rotation.  
12-left hip: Rapidly pikes to 90° at peak backswing, then opens fully mid-salto with outward rotation.  
13-right hip: Synchronized with left hip but may split wider in straddle for balance.  
14-left knee: Extends fully in backswing, then bends sharply during pike before snapping straight in straddle.  
15-right knee: Matches left knee but may delay extension slightly for controlled regrasp.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point, thrusting upward early in swing then tilting forward during rotation.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors rotation, staying aligned until release, then whips forward to aid momentum.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the '(UB) (swing backward or front support) salto forward straddled to hang on high bar' gymnastics element can be recognized and distinguished from similar elements in one concise sentence, focusing on coordination, timing, rotation, and posture.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No joint numbers or bullet points or dashes
2. Use only one sentence, no line breaks
3. Begin immediately with the description (no "The element is...")
4. Emphasize what makes this element visually or structurally different from other similar elements in the same set
5. Keep it concise (<70 tokens)

Round 5 Answer:
This element is distinguished by a powerful backward swing into a sharp pike, followed by a forward straddled salto with wide leg split, rapid hip thrust, and whipping shoulder rotation before regrasping the bar in an open-hang position.
