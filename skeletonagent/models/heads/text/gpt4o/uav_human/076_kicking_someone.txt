Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'kicking someone' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body initiates the kicking action by shifting weight onto the supporting leg, bending the knee of the kicking leg, then rapidly extending it forward to strike the target with the foot before retracting the leg back to the original position.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'kicking someone': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains stable with eyes focused on the target.  
Hand: May clench into a fist or stay open for balance.  
Arm: Swings slightly backward or extends for counterbalance.  
Hip: Rotates forward to generate power for the kick.  
Leg: The knee bends before extending forcefully toward the target.  
Foot: Strikes the target with the toes, instep, or heel.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'kicking someone' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Slightly tilts forward as the body leans into the kick.  
2-right shoulder: Rotates backward to counterbalance the kicking leg.  
5-left shoulder: Moves forward to aid hip rotation for power.  
8-right hip: Drives forward to generate momentum for the kick.  
9-right knee: Bends then extends rapidly to propel the foot.  
10-right ankle: Flexes before impact, then extends to strike.  
11-left hip: Stabilizes and supports weight during the kick.  
12-left knee: Slightly bends to maintain balance and posture.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'kicking someone' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features for recognizing a kicking action include the forward tilt of the head, counterbalancing shoulder rotation, driving hip movement, rapid knee extension of the kicking leg, and stabilizing posture from the supporting leg.
