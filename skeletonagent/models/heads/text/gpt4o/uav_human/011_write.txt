Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'write' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'write' action by first positioning the hand around a writing tool, typically a pen or pencil, with the fingers gripping it firmly. The wrist and forearm stabilize the hand while the fingers make small, controlled movements to form letters on a surface. The shoulder and elbow adjust to guide the hand across the page, maintaining consistent pressure and flow. The eyes track the writing progress, coordinating with the hand to ensure accuracy. The posture remains upright, with the non-dominant hand often holding the paper steady. The process repeats as the hand moves from left to right or top to bottom, depending on the writing direction.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'write': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to focus on the writing surface.  
Hand: Grips the pen and moves precisely to form letters.  
Arm: Supports the hand, adjusting position for smooth writing.  
Hip: Remains stable to maintain seated or standing balance.  
Leg: Stays bent or relaxed to support posture.  
Foot: Rests flat or slightly raised for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'write' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
4, 6, 7

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
4-right wrist: Moves precisely to control pen strokes.  
6-left elbow: Adjusts to stabilize and guide the left hand.  
7-left wrist: Holds paper steady for smooth writing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'write' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'write' action is recognized by precise wrist movements controlling the pen, stabilized by elbow adjustments and steady hand positioning for smooth strokes.
