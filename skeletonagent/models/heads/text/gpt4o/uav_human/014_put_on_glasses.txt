For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Slightly tilts forward as glasses approach face.

6-left elbow: Bends if left hand helps adjust glasses.  
7-left wrist: Fine-tunes frame placement if used.  
14-right eye: Aligns with the right lens during positioning.  
15-left eye: Aligns with the left lens during positioning.
