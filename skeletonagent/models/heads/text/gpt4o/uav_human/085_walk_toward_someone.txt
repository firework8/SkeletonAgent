Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'walk toward someone' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body initiates walking toward someone by shifting weight onto one leg, swinging the opposite leg forward with bent knee, then alternating steps while maintaining balance through coordinated arm movements and upright posture.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'walk toward someone': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright with gaze forward or slightly down.  
Hand: Sways slightly or stays relaxed at the sides.  
Arm: Swings gently opposite to the leg movement.  
Hip: Rotates slightly with each step for balance.  
Leg: Alternates forward with bent knee and controlled motion.  
Foot: Lands heel-first, then rolls to toe for smooth steps.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'walk toward someone' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates slightly forward with arm swing.  
3-right elbow: Bends and extends opposite to leg movement.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward with arm swing.  
6-left elbow: Bends and extends opposite to leg movement.  
8-right hip: Shifts forward to propel right leg.  
11-left hip: Shifts forward to propel left leg.  
9-right knee: Flexes and extends for step motion.  
12-left knee: Flexes and extends for step motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'walk toward someone' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by alternating leg movements with bent knees, coordinated arm swings opposite to legs, slight hip rotations for balance, and upright posture while advancing forward.
