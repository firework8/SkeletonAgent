Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'fishing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'fishing' action by standing or sitting with a relaxed posture, gripping the fishing rod with one hand near the reel and the other further up the handle, then smoothly casting the line forward with a controlled arm motion, followed by gently reeling in the line while maintaining focus on the rod tip for any bites.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'fishing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to watch the line or surroundings.  
Hand: Grips the rod firmly and adjusts tension as needed.  
Arm: Moves smoothly to cast or reel in the line.  
Hip: Shifts weight slightly for balance during casting.  
Leg: Stands steady or adjusts stance for stability.  
Foot: Anchors the body, pressing into the ground.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'fishing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates slightly during casting and reeling.  
3-right elbow: Bends and extends to control rod movement.  
4-right wrist: Flicks forward during casting, adjusts grip.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes posture, supports rod handling.  
6-left elbow: Assists in balancing the rod during motion.  
7-left wrist: Helps guide the line or adjust tension.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'fishing' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'fishing' action is recognized by coordinated arm movements for casting and reeling, wrist adjustments for line control, shoulder rotations for power, and stable lower-body posture for balance.
