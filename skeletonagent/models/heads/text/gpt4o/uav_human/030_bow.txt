Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'bow' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'bow' action by bending forward at the waist while keeping the back straight, lowering the head and torso toward the ground, and then returning to an upright position.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'bow': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts forward and downward.  
Hand: Typically rests at sides or clasps together.  
Arm: Hangs straight or bends slightly at elbows.  
Hip: Hinges forward to bend the torso.  
Leg: Remains straight and stable.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'bow' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Moves downward as head tilts forward.  
2-right shoulder: Lowers slightly as torso bends.  
5-left shoulder: Lowers slightly as torso bends.  
8-right hip: Hinges forward to enable torso bend.  
9-right knee: Slightly flexes for balance.  
11-left hip: Hinges forward to enable torso bend.  
12-left knee: Slightly flexes for balance.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'bow' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'bow' action is recognized by the forward tilt of the head, lowering of the shoulders, forward hinge at the hips, and slight knee flexion while maintaining stable legs and feet.
