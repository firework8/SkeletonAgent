Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'drag someone' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends at the knees and hips, grasps the person or object firmly, then leans backward while pulling with the arms and legs to drag the weight along the ground.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'drag someone': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Looks forward or down at the target.  
Hand: Grips firmly onto the person or clothing.  
Arm: Pulls backward with tension.  
Hip: Hinges slightly forward or braces for leverage.  
Leg: Steps back or braces to generate pulling force.  
Foot: Anchors against the ground for stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'drag someone' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates and lowers to brace for pulling.  
3-right elbow: Bends to generate arm tension.  
4-right wrist: Stabilizes grip on the target.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates and lowers to assist pull.  
6-left elbow: Bends to maintain pulling force.  
8-right hip: Hinges forward to anchor stance.  
11-left hip: Shifts backward to counterbalance.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'drag someone' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by bent elbows and shoulders bracing backward, hips hinging for leverage, and a firm grip while stepping or anchoring to pull weight.
