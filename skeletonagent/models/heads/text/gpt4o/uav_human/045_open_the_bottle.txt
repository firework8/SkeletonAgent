Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'open the bottle' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand reaches for the bottle, grasps the cap firmly, twists it counterclockwise while the other hand stabilizes the bottle until the cap loosens and separates.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'open the bottle': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts forward to focus on the bottle.  
Hand: Grips the cap and twists it counterclockwise.  
Arm: Rotates at the elbow and shoulder to apply torque.  
Hip: Remains stable to maintain balance.  
Leg: Supports the body in a neutral standing position.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground for stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'open the bottle' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates slightly to assist arm movement.  
3-right elbow: Bends to position the hand for gripping.  
4-right wrist: Twists to turn the bottle cap counterclockwise.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes to support the bottle.  
6-left elbow: Holds steady to maintain bottle position.  
7-left wrist: Remains firm to prevent bottle slippage.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'open the bottle' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by the right arm twisting the cap while the left arm stabilizes the bottle, with coordinated shoulder and elbow movements enabling the grip and rotation.
