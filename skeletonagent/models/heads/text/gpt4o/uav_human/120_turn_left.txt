Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'turn left' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body initiates a 'turn left' action by shifting weight slightly to the right foot, pivoting the left foot outward, and rotating the torso and hips counterclockwise while the head and eyes align with the new direction.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'turn left': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns left to align with the new direction.  
Hand: May slightly adjust position for balance or gesture.  
Arm: Swings naturally or stabilizes during rotation.  
Hip: Rotates counterclockwise to initiate the turn.  
Leg: Shifts weight, with the left leg leading the pivot.  
Foot: Left foot pivots outward while the right foot supports.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'turn left' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Turns left to face the new direction.  
2-right shoulder: Rotates slightly backward during the turn.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward to initiate movement.  
8-right hip: Shifts back to support weight during pivot.  
11-left hip: Rotates forward to lead the turn.  
12-left knee: Bends slightly to aid balance and pivot.  
13-left ankle: Pivots outward to change direction.  
16-right ear: Moves backward as the head turns left.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'turn left' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'turn left' action is recognized by the nose and left shoulder rotating forward, the right shoulder and hip shifting backward, the left knee bending slightly, the left ankle pivoting outward, and the right ear moving as the head turns.
