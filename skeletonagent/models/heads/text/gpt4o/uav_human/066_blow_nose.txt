Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'blow nose' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'blow nose' action by pressing a tissue against the nostrils, inhaling slightly, then exhaling forcefully through the nose to expel mucus.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'blow nose': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to direct airflow.  
Hand: Holds tissue against nostrils.  
Arm: Positions hand near face.  
Hip: Remains stable for balance.  
Leg: Supports body weight.  
Foot: Stays grounded for stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'blow nose' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Slightly tilts forward as air is exhaled.  
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly to position the right arm.  
3-right elbow: Bends to bring hand toward the face.  
4-right wrist: Adjusts angle to press tissue against nose.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes to support left arm if used.  
6-left elbow: May bend if left hand assists.  
7-left wrist: Adjusts angle if left hand holds tissue.  
14-right eye: Eyes may narrow slightly from exertion.  
15-left eye: Eyes may narrow slightly from exertion.  
16-right ear: Remains still but part of head tilt.  
17-left ear: Remains still but part of head tilt.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'blow nose' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'blow nose' action is recognized by a forward head tilt, bending elbows to bring hands toward the face, wrists adjusting to press a tissue against the nose, and slight shoulder movement while the eyes may narrow from exertion.
