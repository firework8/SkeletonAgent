Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'stretch body' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'stretch body' action by extending the arms overhead, lengthening the spine, and reaching upward while simultaneously straightening the legs and pushing through the toes to create a full-body elongation.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'stretch body': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly upward with the gaze directed forward or upward.  
Hand: Fingers extend fully, palms may face forward or upward.  
Arm: Straightens and reaches overhead, elongating the shoulder joint.  
Hip: Remains stable but may tilt slightly forward as the spine lengthens.  
Leg: Extends fully, engaging thigh and calf muscles.  
Foot: Presses into the ground, toes pointing forward or slightly lifted.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'stretch body' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Lifts upward as the arm extends overhead.  
3-right elbow: Straightens fully during the reaching motion.  
5-left shoulder: Lifts upward as the arm extends overhead.  
6-left elbow: Straightens fully during the reaching motion.  
8-right hip: Stabilizes while the leg extends and spine lengthens.  
11-left hip: Stabilizes while the leg extends and spine lengthens.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'stretch body' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'stretch body' action is recognized by both arms extending overhead with elbows straight, shoulders lifting upward, and hips stabilizing as the legs and spine lengthen.
