Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'dig a hole' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends at the waist and knees, grips a shovel with both hands, drives the blade into the ground by lifting and thrusting, then leverages the handle to lift and toss soil aside, repeating the motion to deepen the hole.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'dig a hole': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Looks downward to focus on the digging spot.  
Hand: Grips the shovel handle tightly for control.  
Arm: Lifts and drives the shovel into the ground.  
Hip: Hinges forward to apply force into the shovel.  
Leg: Bends and straightens to power the digging motion.  
Foot: Steps on the shovel blade to drive it deeper.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'dig a hole' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates and lifts to drive shovel motion.  
3-right elbow: Bends and extends to control shovel leverage.  
4-right wrist: Stabilizes grip and adjusts shovel angle.  
5-left shoulder: Supports balance and counteracts right-side force.  
6-left elbow: Flexes to assist in lifting and stabilizing.  
8-right hip: Hinges forward to generate digging power.  
11-left hip: Shifts weight to maintain posture during digging.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'dig a hole' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated bending and extending of the arms to drive a shovel, forward hinging of the hips for power, weight shifts for balance, and stabilized wrist grips for control.
