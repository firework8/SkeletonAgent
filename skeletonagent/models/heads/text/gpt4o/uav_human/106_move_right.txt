Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'move right' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body shifts its weight to the left foot, then lifts and moves the right foot sideways to the right, followed by transferring weight to the right foot and bringing the left foot to meet it.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'move right': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly right or stays forward for balance.  
Hand: May swing naturally or stay relaxed at the sides.  
Arm: Right arm swings back while left arm swings forward.  
Hip: Shifts right as weight transfers to the right leg.  
Leg: Right leg steps right while left leg supports then follows.  
Foot: Right foot lifts, moves right, then lands heel-first.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'move right' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates slightly back as right arm swings.  
3-right elbow: Bends slightly during right arm swing.  
8-right hip: Shifts right as weight transfers to right leg.  
9-right knee: Flexes when right foot lifts and steps.  
11-left hip: Moves forward to support left leg swing.  
12-left knee: Extends slightly as left leg follows right.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'move right' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'move right' action is recognized by the right shoulder rotating back, right elbow bending slightly, right hip shifting sideways with knee flexion for stepping, while the left hip and knee adjust to support and follow the movement.
