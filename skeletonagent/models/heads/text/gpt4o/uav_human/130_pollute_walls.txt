Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'pollute walls' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'pollute walls' action by extending the arms forward, pressing the palms against a surface, and leaning the torso inward while shifting weight onto the hands to simulate marking or defacing.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'pollute walls': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly forward with eyes focused on the wall.  
Hand: Pressed flat against the wall with fingers spread.  
Arm: Extended forward to reach the wall, elbow slightly bent.  
Hip: Leaning toward the wall for balance and reach.  
Leg: Steady stance with knees slightly flexed for support.  
Foot: Planted firmly on the ground to maintain stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'pollute walls' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates forward to extend the arm toward the wall.  
3-right elbow: Bends slightly to adjust hand placement on the wall.  
4-right wrist: Stabilizes as the palm presses against the surface.  
5-left shoulder: Shifts backward slightly for balance.  
6-left elbow: Holds a relaxed bend to counterbalance the right arm.  
7-left wrist: Remains loose, not actively engaging the wall.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'pollute walls' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'pollute walls' action is recognized by forward shoulder rotation and elbow bend to press one hand against a surface while the opposite arm balances with a relaxed posture, supported by slight hip and leg adjustments for stability.
