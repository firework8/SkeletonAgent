Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'shake arms' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'shake arms' action by rapidly moving the arms back and forth at the shoulders, creating a loose, swinging motion while the hands and wrists remain relaxed.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'shake arms': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Typically remains steady or moves slightly in sync with the arm motion.  
Hand: Flops loosely at the wrist, moving passively with the arm's shaking.  
Arm: Swings rapidly back and forth from the shoulder with relaxed muscles.  
Hip: Stays mostly stable but may sway slightly if the shaking is vigorous.  
Leg: Generally remains still unless the shaking motion affects overall balance.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground unless stepping adjusts for movement.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'shake arms' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates and moves back and forth rapidly.  
3-right elbow: Bends slightly with loose, swinging motion.  
4-right wrist: Flops loosely, following arm movement.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates and moves back and forth rapidly.  
6-left elbow: Bends slightly with loose, swinging motion.  
7-left wrist: Flops loosely, following arm movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'shake arms' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'shake arms' action is recognized by rapid back-and-forth shoulder rotations with loose, swinging elbow bends and floppy wrist movements on both sides.
