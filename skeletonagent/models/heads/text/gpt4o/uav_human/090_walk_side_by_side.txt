Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'walk side by side' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body moves the legs alternately in a coordinated manner, maintaining close proximity to another person while shifting weight from one foot to the other and swinging the arms naturally to balance and propel forward at a matching pace.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'walk side by side': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright with gaze forward or slightly turned toward the companion.  
Hand: Relaxed with slight natural curl, may swing gently or stay still.  
Arm: Swings slightly opposite the leg or remains loosely at the side.  
Hip: Rotates subtly with each step to maintain balance and forward motion.  
Leg: Alternates strides, bending at the knee to advance smoothly.  
Foot: Lifts, swings forward, and lands heel-to-toe in sync with the other person.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'walk side by side' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates slightly forward and back with arm swing.  
3-right elbow: Bends and extends rhythmically during arm movement.  
5-left shoulder: Rotates opposite right shoulder for balance.  
6-left elbow: Flexes and straightens in sync with arm swing.  
8-right hip: Shifts forward with right leg stride.  
11-left hip: Moves opposite right hip to maintain gait.  
9-right knee: Bends to lift and advance the right leg.  
12-left knee: Flexes to step forward in alternation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'walk side by side' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features include coordinated shoulder and hip rotation, alternating arm swings with elbow flexion, and synchronized knee bending for smooth forward strides while maintaining proximity to another person.
