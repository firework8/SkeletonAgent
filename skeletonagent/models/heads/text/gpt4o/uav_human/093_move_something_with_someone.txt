Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'move something with someone' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body coordinates with another person by aligning posture, gripping the object simultaneously, and moving in a synchronized manner, using combined force and communication to transport the object smoothly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'move something with someone': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns to observe the partner and object for coordination.  
Hand: Grips the object firmly while adjusting pressure with the partner.  
Arm: Extends or bends to apply controlled force in the shared movement.  
Hip: Shifts weight to stabilize balance during the collaborative effort.  
Leg: Steps or adjusts stance to support the direction of movement.  
Foot: Anchors or steps to maintain stability and synchronize motion.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'move something with someone' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates and stabilizes to support arm movement.  
3-right elbow: Flexes or extends to adjust pushing/pulling force.  
4-right wrist: Aligns grip and fine-tunes object handling.  
5-left shoulder: Balances force by mirroring right shoulder motion.  
6-left elbow: Coordinates with right elbow for smooth movement.  
7-left wrist: Adjusts grip strength in sync with right wrist.  
8-right hip: Shifts weight to maintain stability during motion.  
11-left hip: Counterbalances right hip for coordinated movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'move something with someone' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder and hip rotation, synchronized elbow flexion, balanced wrist grip adjustments, and weight shifts to enable joint object handling.
