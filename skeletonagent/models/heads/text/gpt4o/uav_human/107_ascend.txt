Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'ascend' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'ascend' action by engaging the leg muscles to push upward, lifting the torso while the arms may assist by pulling or stabilizing, and the core maintains balance as the body moves vertically against gravity.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'ascend': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly upward to focus on the ascent path.  
Hand: Grips or pushes against surfaces for support.  
Arm: Pulls or lifts to assist upward movement.  
Hip: Shifts forward to align the torso for balance.  
Leg: Extends forcefully to propel the body upward.  
Foot: Pushes off the ground or steps onto higher surfaces.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'ascend' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly to aid arm movement.  
3-right elbow: Bends or extends to push or pull upward.  
5-left shoulder: Lifts slightly to aid arm movement.  
6-left elbow: Bends or extends to push or pull upward.  
8-right hip: Shifts forward to align torso during ascent.  
9-right knee: Extends forcefully to propel body upward.  
11-left hip: Shifts forward to align torso during ascent.  
12-left knee: Extends forcefully to propel body upward.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'ascend' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'ascend' action is recognized by upward shoulder and arm movements for lifting or pulling, forward hip shifts for torso alignment, and forceful knee extensions to propel the body upward.
