Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'swing the racket' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body initiates the 'swing the racket' action by rotating the torso and shoulders while shifting weight from the back foot to the front foot, extending the arm to propel the racket forward in a controlled arc, followed by a follow-through to complete the motion.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'swing the racket': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to track the ball.  
Hand: Grips the racket firmly and rotates during the swing.  
Arm: Extends and swings forward in an arc.  
Hip: Rotates to generate power.  
Leg: Shifts weight from back to front.  
Foot: Pivots on the toes for balance.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'swing the racket' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Rotates backward then forward during swing.  
3-right elbow: Bends initially, then extends to strike.  
4-right wrist: Flicks forward at impact for power.  
5-left shoulder: Stabilizes and counterbalances the motion.  
6-left elbow: Slightly bends to maintain posture.  
7-left wrist: Remains firm to support grip.  
8-right hip: Twists to generate rotational force.  
11-left hip: Shifts weight to aid balance.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'swing the racket' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'swing the racket' action is recognized by the coordinated rotation of the shoulders and hips, the bending and extension of the elbows, the flicking motion of the wrist, and the weight shift between legs for balance and power.
