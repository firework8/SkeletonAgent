Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'stagger' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'stagger' action by swaying unsteadily, losing balance momentarily with uneven steps, often due to disorientation or instability.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'stagger': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts or bobs unsteadily with imbalance.  
Hand: Flails or reaches out for support.  
Arm: Swings unevenly to counterbalance.  
Hip: Shifts abruptly side to side.  
Leg: Moves with unstable, uneven steps.  
Foot: Stumbles or drags awkwardly.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'stagger' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Jerks unevenly with imbalance.  
3-right elbow: Bends and extends erratically.  
5-left shoulder: Sways abruptly to counterbalance.  
6-left elbow: Flails loosely for stability.  
8-right hip: Shifts sideways unsteadily.  
11-left hip: Tilts sharply to regain balance.  
9-right knee: Buckles or locks unpredictably.  
12-left knee: Staggers with unstable steps.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'stagger' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'stagger' action is recognized by unsteady jerking of the shoulders, erratic arm movements, abrupt hip shifts, and unstable knee buckling while walking.
