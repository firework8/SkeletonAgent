Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'headache' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'headache' action by tilting the head slightly forward or backward, often accompanied by a hand pressing against the forehead or temple while the eyes may squint or close briefly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'headache': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts forward or backward with tension in the forehead or temples.  
Hand: Presses against the forehead, temples, or covers the eyes.  
Arm: Rests on a surface or bends to bring the hand to the head.  
Hip: Remains still or shifts weight slightly if standing.  
Leg: Stays stationary with minimal movement.  
Foot: Maintains ground contact without shifting.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'headache' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Slightly tilts downward or upward with tension.  
2-right shoulder: Lifts slightly if right hand moves to the head.  
3-right elbow: Bends to bring right hand toward the forehead.  
4-right wrist: Adjusts angle as hand presses against the head.  
5-left shoulder: Lifts slightly if left hand moves to the head.  
6-left elbow: Bends to bring left hand toward the forehead.  
7-left wrist: Adjusts angle as hand presses against the head.  
14-right eye: Squints or closes briefly from discomfort.  
15-left eye: Squints or closes briefly from discomfort.  
16-right ear: Moves subtly with head tilt.  
17-left ear: Moves subtly with head tilt.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'headache' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'headache' action is recognized by a tilted head with hands pressing against the forehead or temples, accompanied by squinting eyes and slight shoulder or arm movements.
