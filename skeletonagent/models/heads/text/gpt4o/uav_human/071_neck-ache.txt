Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'neck-ache' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'neck-ache' action by tilting the head slightly forward or to the side, often with a subtle rotation or stiffness, while the shoulders may tense or rise slightly in response to discomfort.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'neck-ache': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts forward or to the side with stiffness or limited motion.  
Hand: May press against the neck or temple for relief.  
Arm: Often remains relaxed or slightly raised to support the head.  
Hip: Stays neutral with minimal movement.  
Leg: Bears weight evenly with no significant adjustment.  
Foot: Remains planted in place without shifting.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'neck-ache' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Slightly tilts downward or to one side due to neck stiffness.  
2-right shoulder: May lift slightly in response to tension.  
5-left shoulder: May lift slightly in response to tension.  
14-right eye: Subtly squints or adjusts gaze due to discomfort.  
15-left eye: Subtly squints or adjusts gaze due to discomfort.  
16-right ear: Shifts position slightly with head tilt.  
17-left ear: Shifts position slightly with head tilt.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'neck-ache' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The 'neck-ache' action is recognized by a stiff, tilted head with slight shoulder tension, subtle eye squinting, and minor ear shifts due to discomfort.
