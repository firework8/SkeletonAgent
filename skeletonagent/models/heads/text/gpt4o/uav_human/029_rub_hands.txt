Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'rub hands' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands are brought together with palms facing, fingers slightly spread, and moved back and forth in a rhythmic motion, generating friction as the palms and fingers rub against each other.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'rub hands': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Typically remains still or slightly tilted forward with eyes focused on the hands.  
Hand: Palms press together while fingers move back and forth to create friction.  
Arm: Elbows bend slightly as shoulders stabilize the motion of the hands.  
Hip: Remains stationary with minimal movement unless shifting weight.  
Leg: Stays relaxed and mostly motionless, supporting body balance.  
Foot: Flat on the ground, maintaining stability without shifting.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'rub hands' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Slightly rotates and stabilizes arm movement.  
3-right elbow: Bends to allow wrist and hand motion.  
4-right wrist: Flexes as palm moves back and forth.  
5-left shoulder: Slightly rotates and stabilizes arm movement.  
6-left elbow: Bends to allow wrist and hand motion.  
7-left wrist: Flexes as palm moves back and forth.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'rub hands' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The key features recognizing the 'rub hands' action are both wrists flexing as palms move back and forth, supported by bent elbows and slight shoulder rotation.
