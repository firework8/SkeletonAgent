Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'squat' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, bullet points, or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. Keep descriptions brief
4. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body begins the squat by bending the knees and hips to lower the torso while keeping the chest upright and the feet flat, then returns to standing by extending the knees and hips.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'squat': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Keep descriptions brief

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral with gaze forward.  
Hand: Typically rests at sides or extends forward for balance.  
Arm: Stays relaxed or slightly raised for stability.  
Hip: Hinges backward while lowering and rising.  
Leg: Bends at knees to lower and straightens to rise.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground with weight evenly distributed.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 17 skeleton joints.
The labels of the joints are: 1-nose, 2-right shoulder, 3-right elbow, 4-right wrist, 5-left shoulder, 6-left elbow, 7-left wrist, 8-right hip, 9-right knee, 10-right ankle, 11-left hip, 12-left knee, 13-left ankle, 14-right eye, 15-left eye, 16-right ear, 17-left ear.
Based on the movement process of the 'squat' action, please point out all joints that are critical for the recognition of this action, including both left and right sides where applicable. 
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints identified in the previous answer, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List in numerical order (1-17)
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep descriptions brief

Round 4 Answer:
2-right shoulder: Moves slightly back and down during descent.  
3-right elbow: Stays bent or extends slightly for balance.  
5-left shoulder: Moves slightly back and down during descent.  
6-left elbow: Stays bent or extends slightly for balance.  
8-right hip: Hinges backward as torso lowers.  
9-right knee: Bends to lower body, straightens to rise.  
11-left hip: Hinges backward as torso lowers.  
12-left knee: Bends to lower body, straightens to rise.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize the key features that recognize the 'squat' action in one sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No bullet points or dashes
2. No line breaks
3. No joint labels
4. Keep it concise
5. Start directly with the description

Round 5 Answer:
The squat is recognized by the bending of knees and hips to lower the torso while keeping the shoulders stable and feet flat, followed by straightening to return upright.
