Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'hugging' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The arms extend forward and wrap around another person, pulling them close while the torso leans slightly forward to embrace.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'hugging': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or rests against the other person.  
Hand: Opens or gently presses against the other's back or shoulders.  
Arm: Bends at the elbow to wrap around the other person.  
Hip: May shift weight slightly but remains mostly stable.  
Leg: Stays grounded with minimal movement.  
Foot: Stays flat on the floor for balance.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'hugging' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward and inward to initiate the embrace.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates forward and inward to mirror the left shoulder.  
8-left elbow: Bends to bring the left arm around the other person.  
9-right elbow: Bends to bring the right arm around the other person.  
10-left wrist: Extends slightly as the hand rests on the other's back.  
11-right wrist: Extends slightly as the hand rests on the other's back.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly to close the distance.  
20-mid shoulder: Acts as a pivot for arm and upper body movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'hugging' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The hugging action is recognized by both shoulders rotating inward with elbows bending to wrap the arms forward, while the thorax leans slightly to close distance, creating a distinctive encircling motion.
