Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'bandaging' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands grasp the bandage, wrap it around the injured area with alternating circular and diagonal motions, secure it with a knot or clip, and smooth out any wrinkles for a snug fit.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'bandaging': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly to observe the wound and guide bandage placement.  
Hand: Grips and maneuvers the bandage, applying tension while wrapping.  
Arm: Moves steadily to unroll and position the bandage around the injury.  
Hip: Shifts weight to stabilize posture while bending or reaching.  
Leg: Adjusts stance to maintain balance during wrapping motions.  
Foot: Stays grounded to support body stability during the process.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'bandaging' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and stabilizes to position the arm for wrapping.  
7-right shoulder: Adjusts angle to guide the bandage around the injury.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to control reach and tension of the bandage.  
9-right elbow: Bends precisely to apply even pressure during wrapping.  
10-left wrist: Tilts and twists to maneuver the bandage smoothly.  
11-right wrist: Fine-tunes grip and direction for secure placement.  
18-mid hip: Shifts subtly to maintain balance while reaching.  
19-thorax: Leans slightly forward to improve access and visibility.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'bandaging' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The bandaging action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotations guiding the arms, precise elbow bends controlling tension, subtle wrist adjustments maneuvering the wrap, and a stabilized yet adaptive torso posture ensuring controlled application.
