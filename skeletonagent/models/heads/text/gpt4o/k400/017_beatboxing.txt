Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'beatboxing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs beatboxing by rapidly coordinating lip, tongue, and cheek movements to create percussive sounds, often accompanied by controlled breathing and occasional vocalizations, while maintaining rhythmic body movements or head nods.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'beatboxing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slight nods or bobs to the rhythm.  
Hand: Quick taps or snaps for added percussion.  
Arm: Subtle swings or pulses matching beats.  
Hip: Minimal sways or light shifts in stance.  
Leg: Gentle bends or knee lifts for groove.  
Foot: Taps or light stomps to keep time.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'beatboxing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Subtle rhythmic lifts and drops.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder with slight lag.  
10-left wrist: Quick flicks or taps for sound accents.  
11-right wrist: Complements left wrist with varied beats.  
12-left hip: Light sways or shifts for groove.  
13-right hip: Syncs with left hip in relaxed motion.  
19-thorax: Gentle forward-back pulses for breath control.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'beatboxing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Beatboxing is recognized by rhythmic shoulder lifts, quick wrist flicks for percussion, relaxed hip sways for groove, and subtle thorax pulses synced with breath control, creating a distinct sound-focused movement pattern.
