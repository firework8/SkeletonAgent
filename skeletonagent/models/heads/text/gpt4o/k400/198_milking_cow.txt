Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'milking cow' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'milking cow' action by alternately squeezing and releasing the udder with one hand while the other hand steadies the teat, rhythmically pulling downward to extract milk.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'milking cow': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward with eyes focused on the udder.  
Hand: Squeezes the teat rhythmically with fingers in a pulsing motion.  
Arm: Moves steadily up and down while maintaining a firm grip.  
Hip: Sits balanced on a stool or crouches slightly for stability.  
Leg: Bent at the knee to support a stable milking posture.  
Foot: Planted firmly on the ground for balance and leverage.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'milking cow' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing slight rotation for arm movement.  
7-right shoulder: Moves slightly forward and back with milking rhythm.  
8-left elbow: Maintains a bent posture for controlled hand positioning.  
9-right elbow: Flexes and extends to drive the milking motion.  
10-left wrist: Remains steady to support grip or stabilize the udder.  
11-right wrist: Articulates to guide the squeezing and pulling motion.  
12-left hip: Anchors posture while seated or crouched.  
13-right hip: Balances weight shifts during repetitive milking.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'milking cow' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The 'milking cow' action is recognized by a rhythmic forward-back elbow flexion paired with precise wrist articulation for squeezing, while shoulders and hips stabilize the torso in a slightly forward-leaning seated posture.
