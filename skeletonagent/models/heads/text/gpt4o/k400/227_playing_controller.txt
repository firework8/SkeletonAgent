Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing controller' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands grip the controller, thumbs press buttons, fingers adjust triggers, wrists tilt slightly, and arms remain steady while seated or held up.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing controller': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or adjusts angle to focus on the screen.  
Hand: Grips controller, thumbs press buttons, fingers manipulate triggers.  
Arm: Holds controller steady, elbows bent at a relaxed angle.  
Hip: Remains stable in seated or standing position, slight shifts for comfort.  
Leg: Bent if seated, planted firmly if standing, minimal movement.  
Foot: Flat on floor if seated, may tap lightly during intense gameplay.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing controller' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes arm, slight rotation for controller positioning.  
7-right shoulder: Balances arm movement, adjusts for dominant hand grip.  
8-left elbow: Maintains bent angle, allows wrist flexibility.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to hold controller at comfortable height.  
10-left wrist: Tilts for button access, minimal active movement.  
11-right wrist: Precise motions for button presses and stick control.  
18-mid hip: Anchors posture, shifts subtly for balance adjustments.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns upper body, reduces strain during play.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing controller' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by bent elbows stabilizing the controller, subtle wrist tilts for button presses, slight shoulder rotations for grip adjustments, and a steady mid-hip anchor with minimal torso movement.
