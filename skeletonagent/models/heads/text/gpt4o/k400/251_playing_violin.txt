Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing violin' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The left hand presses strings on the violin's neck while the right hand moves the bow across the strings, creating sound through coordinated finger and arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing violin': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly toward the violin for better alignment and focus.  
Hand: Left fingers press strings precisely; right hand grips and maneuvers the bow.  
Arm: Left arm supports the violin; right arm moves the bow smoothly across strings.  
Hip: Remains stable and balanced to support upper body posture.  
Leg: Stands firmly or sits upright, providing a steady base.  
Foot: Grounds the body, maintaining stability and weight distribution.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing violin' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes and slightly elevates to support violin positioning.  
7-right shoulder: Controls bowing arm movement with subtle rotation.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to adjust violin angle and finger reach.  
9-right elbow: Hinges smoothly to guide bow strokes.  
10-left wrist: Curves naturally for finger agility on strings.  
11-right wrist: Maintains flexibility for bow control and articulation.  
18-mid hip: Anchors posture, balancing upper body motion.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns upper torso for coordinated arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing violin' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The violin-playing motion is recognized by the left shoulder stabilizing the instrument while the right shoulder guides the bow arm, with precise wrist and elbow coordination for finger placement and bow control, all anchored by balanced hip and torso alignment.
