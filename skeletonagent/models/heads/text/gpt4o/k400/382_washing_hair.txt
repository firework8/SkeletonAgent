Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'washing hair' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands reach up to the head, fingers spread and massage the scalp in circular motions while water runs through the hair, then rinse and repeat as needed.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'washing hair': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts back slightly under water or leans forward as hands scrub.  
Hand: Fingers spread and massage scalp in circular motions with shampoo.  
Arm: Raises and bends at the elbow to reach different parts of the head.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance while standing.  
Leg: Stays steady with slight knee adjustments for stability.  
Foot: Remains planted on the ground, toes gripping if surface is slippery.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'washing hair' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts and rotates to position arm for hair washing.  
7-right shoulder: Raises and adjusts to guide hand movements.  
8-left elbow: Bends to bring hand closer to the head.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to allow wrist to reach different scalp areas.  
10-left wrist: Tilts and twists to aid scrubbing motions.  
11-right wrist: Moves fluidly for shampoo application and rinsing.  
19-thorax: Slightly twists or leans to assist arm reach.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes as arms move asymmetrically.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'washing hair' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by alternating shoulder lifts with bent elbows guiding wrists in circular scalp scrubbing motions, while the thorax subtly adjusts for balance and the mid-shoulder stabilizes asymmetrical arm movements.
