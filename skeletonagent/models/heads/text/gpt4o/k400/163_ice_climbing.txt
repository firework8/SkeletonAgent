Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'ice climbing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body alternates arms and legs to grip ice tools and kick crampons into the ice, pulling upward while maintaining balance against the vertical surface.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'ice climbing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Looks upward to plan the next move or down to check footholds.  
Hand: Grips the ice tool tightly while swinging or stabilizing.  
Arm: Pulls the body upward when lifting the ice tool or extends to reach higher.  
Hip: Stays close to the wall to maintain balance and conserve energy.  
Leg: Pushes upward by straightening to propel the body higher.  
Foot: Kicks crampons into the ice to secure stable footing.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'ice climbing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts to swing the ice tool upward.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or pulls the body up during tool placement.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to pull body closer or extends to reach higher.  
9-right elbow: Alternates between bending for leverage and straightening for reach.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts grip angle for optimal ice tool placement.  
11-right wrist: Maintains firm control while swinging or anchoring the tool.  
14-left knee: Bends to lift leg and kick crampon into ice.  
15-right knee: Extends to push body upward from footholds.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'ice climbing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Alternating shoulders drive upward pulls while elbows flex and extend dynamically, wrists adjust grip angles for tool placement, and knees bend sharply to kick crampons into ice, creating a rhythmic vertical ascent pattern.
