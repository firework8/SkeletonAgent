Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'marching' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs marching by alternately lifting each knee upward while swinging the opposite arm forward, maintaining an upright posture and rhythmic stride.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'marching': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright and steady, facing forward.  
Hand: Loosely curled or open, swinging naturally.  
Arm: Swings forward and backward opposite the legs.  
Hip: Rotates slightly with each step to maintain balance.  
Leg: Lifts at the knee with each step, thigh parallel to ground.  
Foot: Lands heel-first, then rolls to toes before pushing off.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'marching' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly backward as the opposite leg lifts.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates slightly backward as the opposite leg lifts.  
8-left elbow: Bends slightly during arm swing, matching opposite leg movement.  
9-right elbow: Bends slightly during arm swing, matching opposite leg movement.  
14-left knee: Lifts forward with thigh parallel to the ground.  
15-right knee: Lifts forward with thigh parallel to the ground.  
16-left ankle: Flexes as foot lifts, then extends for heel-to-toe motion.  
17-right ankle: Flexes as foot lifts, then extends for heel-to-toe motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'marching' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Marching is recognized by alternating knee lifts with thighs parallel to the ground, synchronized opposite arm swings with slight elbow bends, and a heel-to-toe footfall pattern while maintaining upright posture and rhythmic shoulder rotation.
