Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'spinning poi' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'spinning poi' action by rotating weighted balls on tethers in circular or figure-eight patterns using coordinated wrist, arm, and torso movements while maintaining balance and rhythm.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'spinning poi': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Typically steady with slight tilting or turning to track poi movement.  
Hand: Rotates wrists to control poi direction, speed, and pattern.  
Arm: Moves in smooth arcs or circles to guide poi trajectory.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance during spins.  
Leg: Steps or adjusts stance to stabilize body during motion.  
Foot: Anchors movement with light steps or pivots for positioning.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'spinning poi' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and stabilizes to guide arm movements.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates and stabilizes to guide arm movements.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to adjust poi arc height.  
9-right elbow: Flexes and extends to adjust poi arc height.  
10-left wrist: Actively rotates to control poi spin direction.  
11-right wrist: Actively rotates to control poi spin direction.  
18-mid hip: Shifts weight subtly for balance during spins.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors upper body coordination for smooth motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'spinning poi' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The 'spinning poi' action is recognized by synchronized circular wrist rotations guiding the poi, supported by fluid elbow and shoulder arcs, subtle hip weight shifts for balance, and anchored upper-body coordination from the mid-shoulder.
