Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'folding napkins' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands grasp a napkin’s edges, folding it inward by bringing the fingers together, then smoothing the crease with palms or fingertips to create neat folds.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'folding napkins': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward to observe the folding process.  
Hand: Grips and manipulates the napkin edges with precise finger movements.  
Arm: Moves inward to bring napkin edges together, elbows bending slightly.  
Hip: Remains stable with minimal shifting to maintain balance.  
Leg: Supports posture with slight knee flexion if standing.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'folding napkins' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly rotates inward to position arms for folding.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, stabilizing arm movement.  
8-left elbow: Bends to bring wrist toward the body for precise folding.  
9-right elbow: Flexes symmetrically to assist in napkin manipulation.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts angle to grip and smooth napkin edges.  
11-right wrist: Works in tandem with left wrist for even folding.  
18-mid hip: Anchors posture, preventing excessive torso movement.  
20-mid shoulder: Maintains upper body alignment during folding.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'folding napkins' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by symmetrical shoulder stabilization, coordinated elbow flexion for inward folding motions, precise wrist adjustments for edge alignment, and a steady mid-hip anchor preventing torso sway while the hands manipulate the napkin.
