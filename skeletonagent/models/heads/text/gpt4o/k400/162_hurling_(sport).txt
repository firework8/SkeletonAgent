Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'hurling (sport)' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The player grips the hurley, swings it upward to strike the sliotar mid-air or off the ground, then follows through with a controlled motion to direct the ball toward the target.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'hurling (sport)': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tracks the sliotar with sharp focus, adjusting for positioning.  
Hand: Grips the hurley firmly, adjusting for control during the swing.  
Arm: Swings the hurley with power, extending forward or upward to strike.  
Hip: Rotates explosively to generate force during the swing.  
Leg: Steps forward or pivots to stabilize and drive momentum.  
Foot: Anchors stance or pushes off for balance and power transfer.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'hurling (sport)' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward during wind-up, then forward forcefully during strike.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes torso while left shoulder drives swing, aiding power transfer.  
8-left elbow: Flexes during backswing, extends sharply to propel hurley forward.  
9-right elbow: Maintains slight bend for control, adjusts to guide swing direction.  
10-left wrist: Snaps forward at impact for precision and added sliotar speed.  
11-right wrist: Fine-tunes grip pressure, ensuring hurley angle accuracy.  
12-left hip: Twists open during backswing, then drives rotation into strike.  
13-right hip: Anchors lower body, resisting rotation to generate torque.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'hurling (sport)' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The hurling action is recognized by a forceful rotation of the left shoulder and hip driving the swing, a sharp extension of the left elbow and wrist at impact, while the right side stabilizes with controlled resistance to generate torque and precision.
