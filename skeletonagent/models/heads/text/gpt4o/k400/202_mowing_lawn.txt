Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'mowing lawn' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends slightly at the waist, grips the mower handle, and pushes it forward with alternating steps while maintaining a steady pace.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'mowing lawn': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward with eyes watching the mowing path.  
Hand: Grips the mower handle firmly, adjusting pressure as needed.  
Arm: Extends forward to push the mower, alternating slight bends at the elbow.  
Hip: Rotates slightly with each step to maintain balance and momentum.  
Leg: Steps forward in rhythm with the mower's movement, bending slightly at the knee.  
Foot: Pushes off the ground to propel forward, maintaining steady contact.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'mowing lawn' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward and back with each push of the mower.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, stabilizing the pushing motion.  
8-left elbow: Bends and extends to control mower handle distance.  
9-right elbow: Adjusts with left elbow for balanced force.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight forward during stepping.  
13-right hip: Rotates slightly to aid stride momentum.  
14-left knee: Flexes with each step to absorb movement.  
15-right knee: Coordinates with left knee for smooth walking.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'mowing lawn' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The "mowing lawn" action is recognized by alternating shoulder rotations and elbow bends while pushing forward, synchronized with slight hip shifts and rhythmic knee flexions to maintain steady walking momentum.
