Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'krumping' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs krumping with rapid, exaggerated movements involving sharp arm swings, chest pops, and aggressive stomps, all driven by high energy and emotional intensity.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'krumping': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Jerks sharply side to side or forward with quick snaps.  
Hand: Flicks rapidly with tense fingers, often in claw-like shapes.  
Arm: Swings aggressively in wide, exaggerated motions or stiff punches.  
Hip: Thrusts or pops abruptly in sync with stomps or chest movements.  
Leg: Stomps forcefully or kicks out with sudden, powerful energy.  
Foot: Slams the ground hard, often with quick shuffles or pivots.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'krumping' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Pops aggressively upward or swings with sharp, exaggerated motions.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder with forceful, asymmetrical jerks.  
8-left elbow: Snaps sharply inward or outward during arm swings.  
9-right elbow: Drives punches or stiffens abruptly in oppositional movements.  
10-left wrist: Flicks rapidly with tense, claw-like hand gestures.  
11-right wrist: Executes sharp, staccato waves or punches.  
12-left hip: Thrusts forward or sideways with abrupt, angular energy.  
13-right hip: Pops in sync with stomps, often opposing the left hip.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'krumping' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Krumping is recognized by explosive, asymmetrical joint movements—shoulders jerking sharply, elbows snapping with rigid angles, wrists flicking aggressively, and hips popping in abrupt thrusts—all driven by high-energy, staccato rhythms and exaggerated tension.
