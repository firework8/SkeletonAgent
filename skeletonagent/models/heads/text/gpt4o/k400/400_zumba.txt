3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Sways or bobs rhythmically to the beat.

Based on the movement process of the 'zumba' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks

For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts dynamically with arm swings.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder with energetic up-down motion.  
12-left hip: Swivels and thrusts sharply in sync with steps.

Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'zumba' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Zumba is recognized by dynamic shoulder rotations, sharp hip swivels and thrusts, rapid knee bends during steps, and fluid ankle pivots that together create its signature Latin-inspired aerobic dance motion.
