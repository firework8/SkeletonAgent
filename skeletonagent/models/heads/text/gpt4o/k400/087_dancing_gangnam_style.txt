Based on the movement process of the 'dancing gangnam style' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts and drops rhythmically with arm swings.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, adding exaggerated lasso motion.  
8-left elbow: Bends sharply during hops, then extends outward.  
9-right elbow: Flicks upward in sync with wrist during lasso move.  
12-left hip: Shifts side to side with bouncing steps.  
13-right hip: Pops outward in exaggerated sway opposite left hip.  
14-left knee: Bends inward during hops, adds playful bounce.  
15-right knee: Matches left knee but with stronger emphasis on cross-steps.

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'dancing gangnam style' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The dance is recognized by exaggerated shoulder lifts and drops, sharp elbow flicks with wrist lassoing, rhythmic hip pops with side-to-side shifts, and playful knee bends during bouncy cross-step hops.
