Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cleaning windows' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The arms move in alternating circular or side-to-side motions while the hands grip a cloth or squeegee, with the torso slightly leaning forward and the legs maintaining a stable stance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cleaning windows': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts or turns to observe the cleaning area.  
Hand: Grips cloth or squeegee while moving in controlled strokes.  
Arm: Extends and retracts in smooth, repetitive motions.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to adjust reach and balance.  
Leg: Bends slightly or steps to reposition the body.  
Foot: Stays planted or steps lightly for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'cleaning windows' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts slightly to extend reach.  
7-right shoulder: Moves in sync with the arm for sweeping motions.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to control wiping distance.  
9-right elbow: Bends to adjust pressure during squeegee strokes.  
10-left wrist: Twists slightly for precise cloth movements.  
11-right wrist: Angles firmly for squeegee control.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight to stabilize side-to-side motion.  
13-right hip: Balances body during forward leans.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'cleaning windows' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by alternating shoulder rotations driving circular or side-to-side arm sweeps, with elbows dynamically adjusting reach, wrists fine-tuning tool control, and hips subtly shifting weight to maintain balance during forward-leaning wiping motions.
