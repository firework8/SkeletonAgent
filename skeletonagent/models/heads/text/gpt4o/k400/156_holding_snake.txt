Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'holding snake' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends slightly at the waist, arms extending forward with palms facing inward, fingers gently curved as if cradling an invisible serpent, while the legs remain grounded for balance.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'holding snake': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward with eyes focused downward.  
Hand: Fingers gently curl inward, palms facing each other as if cradling.  
Arm: Extends forward with elbows slightly bent for flexibility.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance and stability.  
Leg: Stays grounded with knees softly bent for control.  
Foot: Remains flat on the floor, toes lightly gripping for steadiness.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'holding snake' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly lowered and rotated forward for arm extension.  
7-right shoulder: Mirroring left, slightly lowered and forward-rotated.  
8-left elbow: Bent at ~90 degrees, maintaining flexible arm posture.  
9-right elbow: Similarly bent, matching left elbow's angle.  
10-left wrist: Slightly flexed, fingers curved inward as if holding.  
11-right wrist: Mirroring left, flexed with controlled finger tension.  
18-mid hip: Subtly shifted forward for balance and weight distribution.  
20-mid shoulder: Leans slightly forward, aligning with arm movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'holding snake' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The "holding snake" action is recognized by forward-leaning shoulders and mid-hip, bent elbows forming a cradle, flexed wrists with gently curled fingers, and a subtle weight shift forward—creating the illusion of carefully supporting an unseen object.
