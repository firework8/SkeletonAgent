Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'waxing legs' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The 'waxing legs' action involves bending at the waist, extending one leg upward while balancing on the other, and using smooth, controlled motions to apply wax in the direction of hair growth, then swiftly removing the strip against the grain.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'waxing legs': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to observe the waxing area.  
Hand: Grips the wax strip firmly and pulls swiftly against hair growth.  
Arm: Extends and retracts to apply wax and remove strips.  
Hip: Shifts weight to stabilize the body during leg positioning.  
Leg: Lifts and straightens to expose the area being waxed.  
Foot: Presses into the ground to maintain balance.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'waxing legs' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to extend the arm for wax application.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes as the dominant arm pulls the wax strip.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust hand position during wax spreading.  
9-right elbow: Extends sharply when removing the strip.  
12-left hip: Shifts backward to lift the left leg for waxing.  
13-right hip: Bears weight to maintain balance during the motion.  
14-left knee: Flexes to position the leg for wax access.  
15-right knee: Slightly bends to stabilize the standing posture.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'waxing legs' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The 'waxing legs' action is recognized by a weight-shifting hip stance with one knee flexed for access while the opposite arm performs a sharp elbow extension during strip removal, contrasted by subtle shoulder rotations for precise wax application.
