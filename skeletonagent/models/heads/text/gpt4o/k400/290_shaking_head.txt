Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'shaking head' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The head rotates side to side along the cervical spine, pivoting at the neck with alternating lateral movements.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'shaking head': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Rotates side to side from the neck.  
Hand: Typically remains still or loosely follows arm movement.  
Arm: May sway slightly if relaxed but generally inactive.  
Hip: Stays stationary unless exaggerated motion is involved.  
Leg: Bears weight but does not move significantly.  
Foot: Stays planted on the ground without shifting.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'shaking head' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Moves side to side with head rotation.  
2-left eye: Shifts slightly left when head turns right.  
3-right eye: Shifts slightly right when head turns left.  
4-left ear: Moves laterally opposite to head direction.  
5-right ear: Moves laterally opposite to head direction.  
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes with minimal compensatory motion.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes with minimal compensatory motion.  
19-thorax: Provides base support but remains mostly still.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors neck movement with slight adjustments.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'shaking head' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The shaking head action is recognized by the nose, eyes, and ears moving laterally in alternating directions while the shoulders and thorax remain nearly still, creating a distinct side-to-side head rotation with minimal upper-body involvement.
