Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'bench pressing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The lifter lies on a bench, grips the barbell with hands wider than shoulder-width, lowers it to the chest, then pushes it upward until arms are fully extended.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'bench pressing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains pressed against the bench with a neutral spine.  
Hand: Grips the barbell firmly with palms facing forward.  
Arm: Lowers the barbell to the chest, then extends upward to lockout.  
Hip: Stays in contact with the bench, maintaining stability.  
Leg: Feet planted firmly, driving force through the floor.  
Foot: Flat on the ground, providing a stable base.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'bench pressing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while arms move, prevents excessive arching.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, maintains bench contact and control.  
8-left elbow: Lowers barbell with control, then extends forcefully upward.  
9-right elbow: Synchronizes with left elbow for balanced pressing motion.  
10-left wrist: Keeps straight to transfer force efficiently to barbell.  
11-right wrist: Aligns with left wrist to maintain grip stability.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'bench pressing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The bench press is recognized by synchronized elbow flexion-extension driving the barbell upward while shoulders stabilize against the bench, wrists remain rigid in grip, and hips/legs maintain grounded tension without lifting.
