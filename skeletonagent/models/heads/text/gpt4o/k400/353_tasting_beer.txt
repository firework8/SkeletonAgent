Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts slightly as arm raises the glass.

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'tasting beer' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The left shoulder lifts slightly as the elbow bends to raise the glass, while the wrist tilts it toward the mouth, accompanied by a subtle forward lean of the thorax and stabilizing adjustments in the right shoulder and arm.
