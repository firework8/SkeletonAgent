For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: May tilt slightly downward as the jaw opens.  
6-left shoulder: Typically remains stable but may rotate slightly if arms move.  
7-right shoulder: Similar to left, stays mostly still with minor adjustments.

Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'sticking tongue out' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by a slight forward tilt of the nose as the jaw opens, minimal shoulder stability with relaxed wrists, and no significant lower-body movement, distinguishing it through subtle upper-body stillness paired with isolated tongue protrusion.
