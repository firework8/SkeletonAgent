Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'garbage collecting' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends at the waist and knees, extends the arms to grasp trash, lifts it by straightening the torso and limbs, then moves to dispose of it in a bin.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'garbage collecting': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to look at the garbage.  
Hand: Grips or pinches the trash firmly.  
Arm: Extends and retracts to reach and lift the garbage.  
Hip: Hinges forward when bending down.  
Leg: Bends at the knee to lower the body.  
Foot: Adjusts stance for balance while lifting.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'garbage collecting' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lowers and rotates forward when bending down.  
7-right shoulder: Lowers and stabilizes during lifting.  
8-left elbow: Bends to reach down, then extends to lift.  
9-right elbow: Bends slightly for balance or assistance.  
12-left hip: Hinges forward to lower the torso.  
13-right hip: Supports weight while bending.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point for forward lean.  
19-thorax: Flexes forward and straightens during action.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'garbage collecting' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by a forward torso lean pivoting at the hips, coordinated shoulder lowering, elbow flexion for reaching, and controlled extension during lifting, with asymmetrical arm movements for grasping and stabilizing.
