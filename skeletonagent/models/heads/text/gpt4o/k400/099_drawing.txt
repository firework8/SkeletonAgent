Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'drawing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand grasps a tool, moves it across a surface with controlled strokes, while the arm and wrist adjust for precision, and the body may lean slightly to maintain balance or reach.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'drawing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or angles to observe the drawing surface.  
Hand: Grips the tool and makes precise strokes with finger and wrist adjustments.  
Arm: Moves smoothly, controlling reach and pressure while stabilizing the hand.  
Hip: Shifts subtly to balance posture or adjust position relative to the surface.  
Leg: Bears body weight, occasionally repositioning for comfort or stance.  
Foot: Anchors the body, maintaining stability with slight shifts in pressure.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'drawing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes and adjusts arm position for drawing range.  
7-right shoulder: Supports arm movement, often dominant in right-handed drawing.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to control hand distance from the surface.  
9-right elbow: Acts as a pivot for precise wrist and hand movements.  
10-left wrist: Fine-tunes angle and pressure of the drawing tool.  
11-right wrist: Executes detailed strokes with controlled flexibility.  
18-mid hip: Anchors posture, subtly shifting for balance during drawing.  
19-thorax: Maintains torso alignment, allowing steady arm motions.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'drawing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Drawing is recognized by the coordinated interplay of shoulder stabilization, elbow pivoting for precision, wrist fine-tuning for strokes, and subtle hip-thorax adjustments to maintain balance while the hand executes controlled tool movements.
