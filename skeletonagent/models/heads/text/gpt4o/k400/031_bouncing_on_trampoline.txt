Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'bouncing on trampoline' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends knees upon landing, then explosively extends legs to propel upward, while arms swing for balance, repeating the cycle with each bounce.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'bouncing on trampoline': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts forward or back to maintain balance.  
Hand: Opens or lightly grips for stability during ascent and descent.  
Arm: Swings upward for momentum and downward for control.  
Hip: Flexes slightly on landing, extends during takeoff.  
Leg: Bends on impact, powerfully straightens to propel upward.  
Foot: Pushes firmly against the trampoline surface to launch.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'bouncing on trampoline' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward and back with arm swing for balance.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, aiding upward propulsion and stability.  
8-left elbow: Bends on descent, extends sharply during takeoff.  
9-right elbow: Synchronizes with left elbow for coordinated push-off.  
12-left hip: Flexes to absorb impact, extends to drive upward.  
13-right hip: Works with left hip for symmetrical leg thrust.  
14-left knee: Compresses on landing, explosively straightens to bounce.  
15-right knee: Matches left knee’s motion for balanced rebound.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'bouncing on trampoline' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The bouncing motion is characterized by synchronized knee and hip flexion-extension for explosive upward propulsion, coordinated with rhythmic shoulder and elbow bending for balance, while maintaining a stable torso alignment during repeated rebound cycles.
