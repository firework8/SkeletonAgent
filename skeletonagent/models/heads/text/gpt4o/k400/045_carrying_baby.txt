Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'carrying baby' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The arms bend at the elbows to cradle the baby against the chest, with one hand supporting the head and the other under the torso, while the torso leans slightly forward for balance and the legs move in a steady walking motion.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'carrying baby': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or sideways to observe the baby.  
Hand: Cradles the baby's head or supports the torso with a gentle grip.  
Arm: Bends at the elbow to hold the baby securely against the chest or hip.  
Hip: Shifts slightly to balance the baby's weight when carrying on one side.  
Leg: Moves steadily with controlled steps to maintain stability.  
Foot: Lifts and lands softly to minimize jostling while walking.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'carrying baby' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lowers slightly and rotates inward to support the baby's weight.  
7-right shoulder: Adjusts upward or forward to help cradle the baby securely.  
8-left elbow: Bends between 45-90 degrees to hold the baby close to the torso.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to position the forearm under the baby for support.  
12-left hip: Shifts outward slightly to counterbalance the baby's weight.  
13-right hip: Stabilizes posture when carrying the baby on one side.  
18-mid hip: Leans forward subtly to maintain balance while walking.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns asymmetrically to accommodate the baby's position.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'carrying baby' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by asymmetrical shoulder and elbow flexion cradling an imagined weight, with forward-leaning mid-hip balance and subtle counter-rotations between upper and lower body to mimic careful infant support.
