Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'ripping paper' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands grasp opposite edges of the paper, fingers flexing to secure grip, then pull in opposing directions with controlled force, tearing the paper along the tension line while arms slightly extend outward.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'ripping paper': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilts forward to focus on the paper.  
Hand: Grips the paper edges with fingers pressing firmly.  
Arm: Pulls outward with controlled tension to tear.  
Hip: Remains stable to support upper body movement.  
Leg: Stays grounded, maintaining balance.  
Foot: Flat on the floor, providing steady support.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'ripping paper' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly rotates inward as arm pulls.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes while opposite arm tears.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to generate pulling force.  
9-right elbow: Maintains slight bend for control.  
10-left wrist: Twists slightly to maximize grip tension.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts angle to resist tearing force.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'ripping paper' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The ripping paper action is recognized by opposing shoulder rotation with one arm pulling while the other stabilizes, coordinated elbow flexion for controlled tearing force, and subtle wrist adjustments to maintain grip tension during the split.
