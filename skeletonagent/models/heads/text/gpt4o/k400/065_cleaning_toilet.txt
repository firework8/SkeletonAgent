Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cleaning toilet' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The person bends at the waist, extends their arm with a cleaning tool, scrubs the toilet surface in circular motions, then straightens up to rinse or repeat.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cleaning toilet': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to observe the cleaning area.  
Hand: Grips the scrub brush or cloth tightly while scrubbing.  
Arm: Moves back and forth or in circles to apply cleaning motion.  
Hip: Hinges forward to lower the torso toward the toilet.  
Leg: Bends at the knee to maintain balance and adjust height.  
Foot: Shifts weight to stabilize the body during movement.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'cleaning toilet' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward to extend the arm toward the toilet.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or assists in balancing the scrubbing motion.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust scrub brush reach and pressure.  
10-left wrist: Flexes to control brush angle and scrubbing direction.  
12-left hip: Hinges forward to lower torso toward the toilet.  
13-right hip: Shifts weight to maintain balance while bending.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point for forward torso lean.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates upper body posture during movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'cleaning toilet' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by a forward hip hinge with torso lean, asymmetric arm movements (one stabilizing, one scrubbing with bent elbow and wrist adjustments), and subtle weight shifts in the lower body for balance.
