Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'scuba diving' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The diver bends knees slightly, leans forward, and steps off the platform, extending arms forward while arching the back to enter the water smoothly, then adjusts posture underwater to begin swimming with slow, controlled fin kicks and arm movements for balance and propulsion.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'scuba diving': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns side to side to observe surroundings and check equipment.  
Hand: Adjusts gear, holds the regulator, and gestures to communicate.  
Arm: Extends forward for balance and moves slowly to aid propulsion.  
Hip: Shifts slightly to maintain neutral buoyancy and streamline posture.  
Leg: Moves in slow, controlled kicks with fins for forward motion.  
Foot: Flexes and points to propel efficiently with fins underwater.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'scuba diving' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to stabilize arm movements during fin kicks.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, aiding balance and propulsion control.  
8-left elbow: Bends moderately to streamline arms while swimming forward.  
9-right elbow: Matches left elbow, maintaining symmetrical hydrodynamics.  
12-left hip: Shifts subtly to adjust buoyancy and finning rhythm.  
13-right hip: Coordinates with left hip for smooth underwater turns.  
14-left knee: Flexes and extends in controlled flutter kicks.  
15-right knee: Synchronizes with left knee for steady propulsion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'scuba diving' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Scuba diving is recognized by symmetrical shoulder rotations stabilizing controlled elbow bends while streamlined hips shift subtly to guide rhythmic knee-driven flutter kicks, all moving with slow, deliberate coordination for underwater propulsion.
