Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'scrambling eggs' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand grips the whisk, wrist rotates rapidly in small circles while the arm moves back and forth across the bowl, blending the eggs until smooth.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'scrambling eggs': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward, eyes focused on the bowl.  
Hand: Grips whisk firmly, fingers flexing with each stirring motion.  
Arm: Moves in short, quick back-and-forth strokes while rotating at the wrist.  
Hip: Slightly shifts weight from side to side for balance.  
Leg: Stands steady, knees slightly bent for stability.  
Foot: Flat on the floor, toes gripping lightly for support.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'scrambling eggs' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly rotates forward and back to assist arm motion.  
7-right shoulder: Moves in sync with the whisking arm, providing stability.  
8-left elbow: Stays mostly static, bent for balance near the body.  
9-right elbow: Flexes slightly as the forearm drives the whisking motion.  
10-left wrist: Remains steady, supporting the bowl if held.  
11-right wrist: Rapidly rotates in small circles to whisk eggs smoothly.  
18-mid hip: Shifts subtly to maintain balance during stirring.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors upper body movement, keeping posture aligned.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'scrambling eggs' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The scrambling eggs action is recognized by the dominant rapid wrist rotation of the whisking hand, supported by subtle forearm flexing and stabilizing shoulder movements, while the torso maintains balance through slight hip shifts and steady posture.
