Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'hurdling' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hurdler sprints forward, lifts the lead leg over the hurdle while extending the trail leg sideways, then quickly brings the trail leg forward to land and continue running.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'hurdling': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Stays forward-facing with eyes focused ahead.  
Hand: Drives forward and back in sync with arm movement.  
Arm: Swings powerfully to maintain balance and momentum.  
Hip: Rotates slightly to allow trail leg clearance.  
Leg: Lead leg lifts high while trail leg swings wide.  
Foot: Lead foot dorsiflexes; trail foot pushes off forcefully.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'hurdling' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives forward with lead arm to maintain momentum.  
7-right shoulder: Pulls back as trail arm swings for balance.  
12-left hip: Rotates forward to lift lead leg over hurdle.  
13-right hip: Extends backward to clear trail leg sideways.  
14-left knee: Flexes sharply to raise lead leg upward.  
15-right knee: Bends outward to swing trail leg around hurdle.  
16-left ankle: Dorsiflexes as lead foot clears hurdle.  
17-right ankle: Pushes off forcefully to propel body forward.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'hurdling' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The hurdling action is recognized by the lead shoulder driving forward while the lead hip and knee lift sharply, the trail shoulder pulling back as the trail hip extends and knee swings wide, with coordinated ankle movements for clearance and propulsion.
