Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'stretching leg' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'stretching leg' action by extending one leg outward while keeping the other stationary, engaging muscles to elongate the limb and improve flexibility.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'stretching leg': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains upright or tilts slightly forward for balance.  
Hand: Grips a surface or rests lightly on the thigh for support.  
Arm: Extends or bends slightly to stabilize the upper body.  
Hip: Hinges forward or shifts to accommodate the leg extension.  
Leg: Extends straight or bends, stretching targeted muscles.  
Foot: Flexes or points to engage calf and ankle muscles.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'stretching leg' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
12-left hip: Hinges forward or shifts to allow leg extension.  
13-right hip: Stabilizes or slightly rotates to support stretching leg.  
14-left knee: Extends or bends to stretch hamstrings or quadriceps.  
15-right knee: Remains stable or adjusts for balance during stretch.  
16-left ankle: Flexes or points to engage calf muscles.  
17-right ankle: Maintains firm contact with the ground for stability.  
18-mid hip: Aligns torso and legs, controlling stretch symmetry.  
19-thorax: Keeps upright or leans slightly for deeper stretch.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'stretching leg' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The 'stretching leg' action is recognized by the forward hinge of the stretching-side hip, full extension or controlled bend of the knee, active ankle flexion or point, while the supporting leg maintains stable hip and ankle alignment with subtle torso adjustments for balance.
