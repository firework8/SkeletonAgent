Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'blowing nose' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand raises a tissue to the nose, fingers pinch the nostrils, and the body exhales forcefully through the nose to expel mucus.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'blowing nose': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to direct airflow downward.  
Hand: Grips tissue and presses against nostrils to seal them.  
Arm: Lifts and bends to position hand at nose.  
Hip: Remains stable with minimal movement.  
Leg: Bears weight evenly without shifting.  
Foot: Stays planted flat on the ground.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'blowing nose' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Tilts slightly downward as air is forcefully exhaled.  
6-left shoulder: Lifts slightly to raise the left arm.  
7-right shoulder: May stabilize or lift minimally if both hands are used.  
8-left elbow: Bends to bring hand toward the face.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts angle to press tissue firmly against nostrils.  
19-thorax: Expands slightly before exhaling, then contracts during blowing.  
20-mid shoulder: Shifts forward subtly as arms move toward the face.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'blowing nose' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by a forward head tilt, bent elbows bringing hands to the nose, subtle shoulder lifts, and a brief thorax expansion followed by forceful contraction as air is expelled through pinched nostrils.
