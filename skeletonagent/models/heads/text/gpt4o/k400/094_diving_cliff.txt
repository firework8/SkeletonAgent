Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'diving cliff' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The diver leaps forward, extends arms overhead, arches the body, and enters the water headfirst with minimal splash.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'diving cliff': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts forward with chin tucked to align with spine.  
Hand: Fingers tightly together and palms facing down for a clean entry.  
Arm: Fully extended overhead in line with the body.  
Hip: Flexes slightly to create an upward arch before straightening.  
Leg: Straightens and lifts to align with the torso mid-air.  
Foot: Points toes to streamline the body during descent.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'diving cliff' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward as arms extend overhead.  
7-right shoulder: Rotates forward in sync with left shoulder for balance.  
8-left elbow: Straightens fully to align arm with body.  
9-right elbow: Locks straight to maintain streamlined form.  
12-left hip: Flexes slightly to initiate upward arch.  
13-right hip: Mirrors left hip for symmetrical body alignment.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point for body rotation.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors arm extension for a clean entry.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'diving cliff' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The diver's shoulders rotate forward as elbows fully extend overhead while the hips flex slightly to create a controlled upward arch before straightening into a streamlined mid-air alignment for a clean headfirst entry.
