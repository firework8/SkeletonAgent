Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'archery' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The archer stands with feet shoulder-width apart, draws the bowstring back with one hand while holding the bow steady with the other, aims, and releases the arrow forward.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'archery': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to align gaze with the target.  
Hand: Grips the bow firmly and pulls the bowstring back.  
Arm: Extends forward to hold the bow steady while the other arm draws back.  
Hip: Stays stable and squared toward the target.  
Leg: Maintains a shoulder-width stance for balance.  
Foot: Anchors firmly on the ground with slight forward pressure.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'archery' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly back as the drawing arm pulls the bowstring.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes the bow arm, keeping it extended forward.  
8-left elbow: Bends sharply to draw the bowstring toward the face.  
9-right elbow: Remains straight to support the bow's extension.  
10-left wrist: Flexes to maintain grip on the bowstring during draw.  
11-right wrist: Holds the bow steady with slight backward tension.  
18-mid hip: Anchors posture, keeping torso aligned with the target.  
20-mid shoulder: Balances tension between both shoulders for stability.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'archery' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The archery action is recognized by the opposing tension between the extended bow arm and the sharply bent drawing arm, anchored by a stable torso and hips, while the shoulders rotate asymmetrically to align the draw with the target.
