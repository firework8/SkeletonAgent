Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'doing nails' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand positions the nail file or polish brush, fingers flex and extend to apply precise strokes, while the opposite hand stabilizes or presents the nails for grooming.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'doing nails': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward or to the side to focus on the nails.  
Hand: Manipulates tools or applies polish with precise finger movements.  
Arm: Adjusts position to reach nails, elbow bending for control.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to maintain balance while seated or standing.  
Leg: Stays still or crosses to support hand positioning.  
Foot: Remains planted or lightly shifts for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'doing nails' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to position arm for nail access.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or adjusts to assist dominant hand movement.  
8-left elbow: Bends to bring hand closer for precise nail work.  
9-right elbow: Flexes or extends to control tool application.  
10-left wrist: Tilts and rotates for fine tool manipulation.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts angle for smooth polish strokes.  
18-mid hip: Shifts subtly to maintain seated or standing balance.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly for better visibility of nails.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'doing nails' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is characterized by precise wrist and finger adjustments paired with slight elbow bends and shoulder rotations for nail grooming, while the torso leans forward for visibility and the hips stabilize posture.
