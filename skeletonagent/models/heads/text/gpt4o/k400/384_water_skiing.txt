Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'water skiing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The skier leans back with knees bent, gripping the handle while being pulled by the boat, using body weight shifts to balance and steer as the skis glide over the water's surface.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'water skiing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Keeps eyes forward and level to maintain balance.  
Hand: Grips the handle firmly with fingers wrapped tightly.  
Arm: Extends straight with slight bend to absorb boat pull.  
Hip: Shifts slightly back to counter the boat's forward force.  
Leg: Stays bent and flexible to absorb water impact.  
Foot: Presses forward against the ski to control direction.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'water skiing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly pulled back to counter the boat's force.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left, stabilizing upper body tension.  
12-left hip: Leans back slightly to maintain balance on skis.  
13-right hip: Aligns with left hip for even weight distribution.  
14-left knee: Bent to absorb water impact and adjust speed.  
15-right knee: Flexes in sync with left for dynamic control.  
16-left ankle: Tilts to steer ski and adjust direction.  
17-right ankle: Works with left for coordinated turning.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'water skiing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The water skiing action is recognized by the shoulders bracing against the boat's pull, hips leaning back for balance, knees flexing dynamically to absorb impacts, and ankles tilting subtly to steer the skis while maintaining a stable upper body.
