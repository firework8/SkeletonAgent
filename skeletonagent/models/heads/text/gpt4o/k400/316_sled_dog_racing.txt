Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'sled dog racing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body leans forward, gripping the sled handles, and alternates pushing off with one foot while gliding on the other, driving the sled forward with rhythmic, powerful strides.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'sled dog racing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly forward, eyes focused ahead.  
Hand: Grips sled handle tightly, maintaining steady pressure.  
Arm: Extends slightly, bracing against sled for control.  
Hip: Hinges forward, shifting weight to aid propulsion.  
Leg: Drives back forcefully, pushing off the ground.  
Foot: Planted firmly, toes pushing for traction and thrust.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'sled dog racing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward with each push.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, aiding balance and propulsion.  
12-left hip: Drives backward to extend the pushing leg.  
13-right hip: Shifts forward as the opposite leg pushes.  
14-left knee: Flexes then extends forcefully during push-off.  
15-right knee: Stabilizes while gliding, then prepares for next push.  
16-left ankle: Planted firmly, toes pushing for traction.  
17-right ankle: Lifts slightly, transitioning between strides.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'sled dog racing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by forceful alternating hip and knee extensions driving the sled forward while shoulders rotate slightly with each push, ankles plant firmly for traction, and the upper body leans forward in a controlled, rhythmic propulsion pattern.
