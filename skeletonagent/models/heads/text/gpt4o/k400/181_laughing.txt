Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'laughing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body shakes rhythmically with shoulders rising, chest expanding, mouth widening, and eyes crinkling as air is expelled in short bursts.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'laughing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts back or shakes slightly with rhythmic bursts.  
Hand: May clap, cover mouth, or wave loosely in the air.  
Arm: Bends at elbows, sometimes swinging or gesturing outward.  
Hip: Sways or shifts side to side with torso movement.  
Leg: Bounces lightly or stomps if laughter is intense.  
Foot: Taps, lifts, or shuffles against the ground.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'laughing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rises and falls rhythmically with laughter.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, shaking with each exhale.  
8-left elbow: Bends slightly, may swing forward with torso movement.  
9-right elbow: Similar to left, flexing loosely during laughter.  
10-left wrist: Flutters or gestures, sometimes covering mouth.  
11-right wrist: Moves expressively, often matching left wrist.  
12-left hip: Sways subtly with upper body vibrations.  
13-right hip: Shifts side to side in sync with laughter bursts.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'laughing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Laughing is recognized by rhythmic shoulder rises, loose elbow bends, expressive wrist flutters (often covering the mouth), and subtle hip sways synchronized with bursts of upper body vibrations.
