Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'front raises' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs front raises by keeping the arms straight or slightly bent, lifting them upward from the sides to shoulder height in front of the torso, then lowering them back down with control.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'front raises': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains neutral, gaze forward.  
Hand: Holds weight with a firm grip, palms facing down or slightly inward.  
Arm: Extends straight or slightly bent, lifts upward to shoulder height.  
Hip: Stays stable, no significant movement.  
Leg: Maintains a fixed, grounded stance.  
Foot: Stays flat on the floor, balanced.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'front raises' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Acts as pivot point for arm elevation.  
7-right shoulder: Acts as pivot point for arm elevation.  
8-left elbow: Maintains slight bend during upward lift.  
9-right elbow: Maintains slight bend during upward lift.  
10-left wrist: Stabilizes weight, aligns with forearm.  
11-right wrist: Stabilizes weight, aligns with forearm.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'front raises' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Front raises are recognized by both shoulders pivoting as the arms lift forward with slight elbow bends, wrists stabilizing the movement while maintaining a straight, controlled path to shoulder height.
