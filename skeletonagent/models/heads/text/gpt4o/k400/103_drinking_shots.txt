Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'drinking shots' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand grasps the shot glass, lifts it to the lips, tilts the head back as the liquid pours into the mouth, then returns the glass to the surface while swallowing.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'drinking shots': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts back slightly as the shot is poured into the mouth.  
Hand: Grasps the shot glass firmly, lifts, and tips it toward the lips.  
Arm: Raises the glass upward in a quick, controlled motion.  
Hip: Remains stable or shifts slightly for balance if standing.  
Leg: Stays planted or adjusts stance if leaning forward.  
Foot: Maintains contact with the ground, providing steady support.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'drinking shots' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts slightly as the arm raises the shot glass.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or adjusts to assist the lifting motion.  
8-left elbow: Bends to bring the glass toward the mouth.  
9-right elbow: May bend slightly for balance or remain steady.  
10-left wrist: Tilts to pour the shot smoothly into the mouth.  
11-right wrist: Often relaxed or used to steady the body.  
19-thorax: Leans back slightly as the head tilts for swallowing.  
20-mid shoulder: Shifts subtly to coordinate arm and torso movement.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'drinking shots' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by the coordinated lift of the shoulder and bend of the elbow to raise the glass, followed by a precise wrist tilt to pour the shot while the thorax leans back slightly and the head tilts to swallow.
