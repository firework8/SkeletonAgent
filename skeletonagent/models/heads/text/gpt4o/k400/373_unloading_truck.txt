Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'unloading truck' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends at the waist and knees to grasp an item from the truck, then straightens while lifting, turns toward the unloading area, and places the item down by bending again.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'unloading truck': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns or tilts to observe the item being unloaded.  
Hand: Grips and releases items with controlled force.  
Arm: Extends to reach, lifts, and lowers items with strength.  
Hip: Hinges forward when bending and straightens when lifting.  
Leg: Bends at the knee to lower and rises to support weight.  
Foot: Shifts stance for balance and pivots during turns.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'unloading truck' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts when reaching for items.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes and assists in lifting heavy objects.  
8-left elbow: Bends to pull items close and extends to lower them.  
12-left hip: Hinges forward when bending down to grab items.  
13-right hip: Shifts weight during turns and stabilizes posture.  
14-left knee: Flexes when squatting and straightens when standing.  
15-right knee: Supports body weight and adjusts balance.  
18-mid hip: Acts as pivot point for torso rotation during unloading.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'unloading truck' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotation and elbow flexion during lifting, synchronized with forward hip hinging and knee flexion when bending, followed by torso rotation pivoting at the mid-hip while weight shifts between legs during unloading.
