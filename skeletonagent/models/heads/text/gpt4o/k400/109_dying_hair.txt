Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'dying hair' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The person reaches for the dye bottle, squeezes the contents into a bowl, mixes it with a brush, sections their hair, applies the dye with gloved hands, waits, then rinses and dries their hair.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'dying hair': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts forward or sideways to expose hair sections.  
Hand: Grips brush or bottle, squeezes dye, applies to hair.  
Arm: Reaches for supplies, lifts to spread dye, holds position.  
Hip: Shifts weight to stabilize posture while standing.  
Leg: Adjusts stance for balance during application.  
Foot: Steps closer to mirror or shifts for comfort.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'dying hair' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts and rotates to reach hair sections.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or assists in dye application.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust brush angle for precise dyeing.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to mix dye or hold hair strands.  
10-left wrist: Tilts and twists to spread dye evenly.  
11-right wrist: Controls bottle squeeze or brush strokes.  
18-mid hip: Shifts weight for balance during movements.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly for better reach.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'dying hair' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder rotations and elbow bends guiding precise wrist motions to apply dye, paired with subtle hip shifts for balance and a forward thorax lean for reach.
