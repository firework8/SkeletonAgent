Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'swimming backstroke' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The swimmer lies on their back, alternately rotating their arms in windmill motions while kicking their legs in a flutter kick, propelling themselves backward through the water.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'swimming backstroke': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains steady, face up, slightly tilted back with waterline near ears.  
Hand: Enters water pinky-first, pulls backward in a curved path, then exits thumb-first.  
Arm: Rotates alternately in a windmill motion, one arm recovering while the other pulls.  
Hip: Rotates slightly with each arm stroke to enhance power and streamline.  
Leg: Flutters up and down continuously with a slight bend at the knee.  
Foot: Points slightly inward, toes breaking surface during upward kicks.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'swimming backstroke' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates backward during arm recovery and forward during pull phase.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, alternating rotation for continuous propulsion.  
8-left elbow: Bends slightly during pull, straightens during recovery above water.  
9-right elbow: Alternates with left elbow, maintaining fluid arm strokes.  
10-left wrist: Remains neutral during pull, flexes slightly at water exit.  
11-right wrist: Coordinates with left wrist for smooth hand entry and exit.  
12-left hip: Rotates slightly inward with each arm stroke for core engagement.  
13-right hip: Counterbalances left hip rotation to maintain body alignment.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'swimming backstroke' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The backstroke is recognized by alternating windmill-like arm rotations with bent-elbow recoveries, synchronized flutter kicks, and subtle counter-rotating hip movements while maintaining a steady head position and backward propulsion.
