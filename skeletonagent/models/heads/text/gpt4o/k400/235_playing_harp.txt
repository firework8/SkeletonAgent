Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing harp' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hands pluck the harp strings with precise finger movements while the arms adjust position to reach different strings, the torso remains upright and slightly forward, and the head tilts gently to monitor hand placement.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing harp': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward and down to observe hand placement.  
Hand: Fingers pluck and dampen strings with controlled precision.  
Arm: Moves horizontally to reach different strings, elbows slightly bent.  
Hip: Remains stable and centered to support upper body posture.  
Leg: Stays relaxed with knees slightly apart for balance.  
Foot: Rests lightly on the ground or pedal, adjusting for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing harp' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly raised and rotated forward to position arm for plucking.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilized but mobile, adjusting for hand reach across strings.  
8-left elbow: Bent at varying angles to control wrist height and finger placement.  
9-right elbow: Moderately flexed, allowing wrist to pivot for precise string contact.  
10-left wrist: Articulates fluidly, directing finger movements for plucking and damping.  
11-right wrist: Maintains slight extension for finger agility and string control.  
19-thorax: Leans forward subtly to align upper body with harp position.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors posture, balancing left and right shoulder movements.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing harp' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The harp-playing motion is characterized by forward-leaning thorax stabilization, asymmetrical shoulder positioning with the left slightly raised, fluid elbow and wrist articulation for precise plucking, and subtle mid-shoulder balance adjustments to maintain posture while reaching across strings.
