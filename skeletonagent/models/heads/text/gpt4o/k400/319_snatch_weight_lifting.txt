Based on the movement process of the 'snatch weight lifting' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward explosively during pull, stabilizes overhead.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, aids in barbell control.  
12-left hip: Thrusts forward to generate power, then drops under bar.  
13-right hip: Synchronizes with left hip for explosive extension.  
14-left knee: Extends forcefully, then bends to catch in squat.  
15-right knee: Coordinates with left knee for balanced movement.  
18-mid hip: Acts as power center for hip drive and squat transition.  
20-mid shoulder: Stabilizes barbell path during pull and overhead lockout.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'snatch weight lifting' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The snatch is recognized by explosive upward shoulder drive paired with a forceful hip thrust, followed by rapid knee bend to drop under the barbell while maintaining a stable overhead lockout with controlled shoulder and hip alignment.
