Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'crying' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
Tears well up in the eyes, cheeks tense slightly, the mouth quivers or opens, shoulders may shake, and hands often cover the face or wipe tears away.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'crying': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts forward or drops slightly with the chin tucking in.  
Hand: Covers the face or wipes tears away in quick, shaky motions.  
Arm: Rises to bring hands to the face or hangs loosely by the sides.  
Hip: Stays mostly still but may shift slightly with uneven breathing.  
Leg: Remains planted but may tremble or feel weak from tension.  
Foot: Stays flat on the ground or shifts weight nervously.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'crying' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
1-nose: Slightly dips downward as the head tilts forward.  
2-left eye: Squints or closes tightly as tears form.  
3-right eye: Squints or closes tightly in sync with the left.  
6-left shoulder: Rises slightly or shakes with uneven breaths.  
7-right shoulder: Rises slightly or shakes similarly to the left.  
10-left wrist: Moves upward to wipe tears or cover the face.  
11-right wrist: Mirrors left wrist in wiping or covering motion.  
19-thorax: Contracts subtly with hitched breathing or sobs.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'crying' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The crying action is recognized by a forward head tilt with eyes squinting or closing, shoulders rising or shaking slightly, wrists moving upward to wipe tears or cover the face, and subtle thorax contractions from hitched breathing.
