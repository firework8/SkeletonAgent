Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'trimming trees' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The person reaches upward with one hand to hold a branch steady while the other hand uses pruning shears to make precise cuts, then steps back to assess the shape before repeating the process on other branches.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'trimming trees': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns and tilts to observe branches.  
Hand: Grips shears firmly and makes cutting motions.  
Arm: Reaches upward and extends to access branches.  
Hip: Shifts weight to maintain balance while reaching.  
Leg: Steps forward or back to reposition stance.  
Foot: Adjusts footing for stability on uneven ground.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'trimming trees' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts and rotates to extend arm toward branches.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes while left arm reaches or vice versa.  
8-left elbow: Bends and extends to adjust pruning shears.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to position shears for precise cuts.  
10-left wrist: Tilts and twists to angle shears correctly.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts grip and control on tool handle.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight to maintain balance during reach.  
13-right hip: Supports stance when leaning or stepping.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'trimming trees' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated shoulder lifts and elbow bends for reaching branches, precise wrist adjustments for cutting, and stabilizing hip shifts to maintain balance while handling shears.
