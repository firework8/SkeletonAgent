Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'contact juggling' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The performer smoothly rolls a ball across their hands, arms, and body, using fluid, circular motions to maintain continuous contact while shifting their weight and adjusting their stance to guide the ball's movement seamlessly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'contact juggling': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly to track the ball's movement.  
Hand: Palms cup and roll the ball with controlled pressure.  
Arm: Flows in smooth arcs to guide the ball's path.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly to aid balance during transfers.  
Leg: Adjusts stance to maintain stability and fluid motion.  
Foot: Steps lightly to reposition the body as needed.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'contact juggling' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lifts to guide ball transitions.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder for fluid arm movements.  
10-left wrist: Flexes and rolls to control ball contact.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts angles to maintain smooth ball motion.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight to stabilize body during transfers.  
13-right hip: Balances posture for seamless directional changes.  
18-mid hip: Anchors core for overall body coordination.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns upper body for controlled flow.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'contact juggling' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Contact juggling is recognized by the fluid, coordinated interplay of shoulders and wrists guiding the ball's path while subtle hip shifts anchor the body's balance, creating a continuous, rolling motion distinct from other manipulations.
