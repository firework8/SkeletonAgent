Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'long jump' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The athlete sprints, plants one foot on the takeoff board, propels upward and forward with a powerful leg drive, swings arms for momentum, extends legs mid-air, and lands heels-first in the sandpit, bending knees to absorb impact.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'long jump': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly forward with eyes focused ahead during approach and takeoff.  
Hand: Fingers spread slightly, palms tense during arm swing for momentum.  
Arm: Swings forcefully backward then forward to assist takeoff and balance.  
Hip: Thrusts forward explosively at takeoff to maximize jump distance.  
Leg: Drive leg extends powerfully at takeoff while free leg swings upward.  
Foot: Takeoff foot plants firmly on the board, toes pointing slightly upward.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'long jump' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives backward then forward during arm swing to generate momentum.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder movement, coordinating with arms for balance.  
12-left hip: Thrusts forward explosively during takeoff to maximize jump distance.  
13-right hip: Works with left hip to stabilize and propel the body upward.  
14-left knee: Extends forcefully during takeoff, driving the body forward.  
15-right knee: Lifts upward mid-air to help extend jump length.  
16-left ankle: Planted firmly on takeoff, then flexes to push off the ground.  
17-right ankle: Stabilizes during landing, absorbing impact with bent knees.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'long jump' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The long jump is recognized by a powerful forward hip thrust at takeoff, explosive knee extension driving upward, coordinated shoulder-arm swings for momentum, and a dynamic mid-air knee lift followed by ankle flexion to absorb landing impact.
