Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'canoeing or kayaking' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'canoeing or kayaking' action by sitting upright, gripping the paddle with both hands, and alternately rotating the torso while pushing and pulling the paddle through the water to propel the boat forward.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'canoeing or kayaking': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains stable, eyes forward, with slight rotation to follow paddle movement.  
Hand: Grips paddle firmly, alternating between pushing and pulling motions.  
Arm: Extends and retracts, driving paddle through water with controlled force.  
Hip: Rotates slightly with torso to enhance paddle stroke power.  
Leg: Presses against footrest or hull for stability and leverage during strokes.  
Foot: Braces against foot pegs, adjusting pressure to aid balance and steering.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'canoeing or kayaking' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward and backward to drive paddle strokes.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, rotating for balanced paddle movement.  
8-left elbow: Bends and extends to control paddle reach and power.  
9-right elbow: Works with left elbow for smooth, alternating strokes.  
10-left wrist: Adjusts paddle angle for efficient water entry and exit.  
11-right wrist: Coordinates with left wrist for fluid paddle handling.  
12-left hip: Twists slightly to enhance torso rotation during strokes.  
13-right hip: Complements left hip, aiding core-driven paddle motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'canoeing or kayaking' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The canoeing/kayaking action is recognized by symmetrical shoulder rotations driving alternating elbow bends and wrist adjustments while the hips twist subtly to enhance torso-powered paddle strokes, all anchored by stable core joints for fluid forward propulsion.
