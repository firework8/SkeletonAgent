Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'sharpening pencil' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The hand grasps the pencil, inserts it into the sharpener, then rotates the wrist while applying slight pressure to shave the wood and expose the lead.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'sharpening pencil': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to observe the pencil tip.  
Hand: Grips the pencil and rotates it steadily in the sharpener.  
Arm: Moves the hand toward and away from the sharpener with controlled force.  
Hip: Remains stable, providing a balanced base.  
Leg: Stays planted, supporting body weight without shifting.  
Foot: Rests flat on the ground, maintaining steady posture.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'sharpening pencil' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing arm rotation.  
7-right shoulder: Supports arm movement during sharpening.  
8-left elbow: Flexes slightly to adjust pencil angle.  
9-right elbow: Controls precise wrist rotation.  
10-left wrist: Holds sharpener steady.  
11-right wrist: Rotates pencil smoothly in sharpener.  
18-mid hip: Maintains balance and posture.  
19-thorax: Anchors upper body for stability.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'sharpening pencil' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by the right wrist's controlled rotation of the pencil paired with precise elbow adjustments, while the left wrist stabilizes the sharpener and the shoulders/hips maintain steady posture without extraneous movement.
