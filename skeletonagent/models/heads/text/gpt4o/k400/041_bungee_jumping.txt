Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'bungee jumping' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The jumper leaps from a high platform, accelerates downward due to gravity, experiences a sudden deceleration as the bungee cord stretches, then rebounds upward in a series of diminishing oscillations until coming to rest.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'bungee jumping': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts back slightly during freefall, then jerks forward as the cord snaps taut.  
Hand: Grips harness tightly or spreads fingers wide during the drop.  
Arm: Extends outward or flails briefly before stabilizing during rebound.  
Hip: Flexes sharply upon cord tension, then straightens during upward bounce.  
Leg: Kicks slightly in freefall, then bends and extends with each rebound.  
Foot: Points toes downward at first, then flexes as the body recoils upward.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'bungee jumping' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Jerks upward during rebound, stabilizing arm movement.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, tense during freefall.  
12-left hip: Flexes sharply as cord pulls, then extends.  
13-right hip: Synchronized with left hip, absorbs rebound force.  
16-left ankle: Points toes down in freefall, flexes on recoil.  
17-right ankle: Matches left ankle, maintains balance during oscillations.  
18-mid hip: Pivots during rebound, core stabilization.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors upper body, shifts with cord tension.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'bungee jumping' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Bungee jumping is recognized by the sudden upward jerk of the shoulders and hips upon cord tension, synchronized ankle flexing during rebound, and a dynamic mid-hip pivot stabilizing the body's oscillating drop and recoil.
