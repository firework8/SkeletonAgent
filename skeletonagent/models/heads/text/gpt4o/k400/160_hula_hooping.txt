Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'hula hooping' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs hula hooping by rhythmically rotating the hips in a circular motion while keeping the torso stable, using coordinated movements to maintain the hoop's momentum around the waist.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'hula hooping': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Remains mostly steady with slight side-to-side balance adjustments.  
Hand: Often held out to the sides or above for balance, with minimal movement.  
Arm: Slightly bent and held away from the body to aid stability.  
Hip: Rotates rhythmically in a circular or back-and-forth motion to keep the hoop spinning.  
Leg: Shifts weight subtly between feet to assist hip movement.  
Foot: Steps lightly in place or shifts slightly to maintain rhythm.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'hula hooping' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
12, 13, 18

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
12-left hip: Rotates in smooth, rhythmic circles to propel the hoop.  
13-right hip: Mirrors left hip with synchronized circular motion.  
18-mid hip: Acts as the central pivot point for hip rotation.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'hula hooping' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Hula hooping is recognized by the mid hip acting as a stable pivot while the left and right hips perform synchronized, rhythmic circular rotations to sustain the hoop's motion.
