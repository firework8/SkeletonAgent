Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'pole vault' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The vaulter sprints down the runway, plants the pole into the box, bends it to store energy, swings upward while rotating, releases the pole at peak height, clears the bar, and lands on the mat.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'pole vault': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilted slightly back during approach, then forward during takeoff and swing.  
Hand: Grips the pole firmly, bottom hand pushes while top hand pulls during plant.  
Arm: Bottom arm extends forcefully at plant, top arm bends to guide pole rotation.  
Hip: Drives upward explosively at takeoff, then tucks tightly during inversion.  
Leg: Lead leg drives up at takeoff, trail leg follows in a quick swing.  
Foot: Lead foot pushes off the ground forcefully, feet tuck together over the bar.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'pole vault' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Drives upward during takeoff, rotates back during swing.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes pole plant, assists in upward rotation.  
8-left elbow: Extends forcefully at plant, bends during swing phase.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to guide pole, extends during push-off.  
12-left hip: Explosively drives upward at takeoff, tucks during inversion.  
13-right hip: Mirrors left hip motion, aids in rotation over bar.  
18-mid hip: Initiates forward momentum, controls body alignment.  
20-mid shoulder: Anchors pole rotation, maintains balance during vault.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'pole vault' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The pole vault is recognized by explosive upward hip drive, forceful shoulder and elbow extension during plant, dynamic mid-body rotation, and a tucking inversion as the joints synchronize to propel the body over the bar.
