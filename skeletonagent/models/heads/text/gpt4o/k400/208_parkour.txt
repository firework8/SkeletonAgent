Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'parkour' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs parkour by dynamically running, jumping, climbing, and vaulting over obstacles with fluid, efficient movements to navigate terrain quickly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'parkour': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Scans terrain and maintains balance with slight tilts.  
Hand: Grips edges or pushes off surfaces for vaults and climbs.  
Arm: Swings for momentum and braces against impacts.  
Hip: Rotates and shifts weight for fluid transitions.  
Leg: Generates power in jumps and absorbs landings.  
Foot: Precisely plants and pushes off for controlled movement.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'parkour' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and extends for arm swings and vaults.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, aiding in balance and propulsion.  
12-left hip: Drives forward motion and absorbs impact during landings.  
13-right hip: Coordinates with left hip for fluid weight shifts.  
14-left knee: Flexes deeply for jumps and cushions landings.  
15-right knee: Works with left knee for explosive power and stability.  
16-left ankle: Adjusts angles for precise foot placement and push-offs.  
17-right ankle: Supports quick directional changes and absorbs shocks.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'parkour' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Parkour is recognized by dynamic shoulder rotations driving explosive arm swings, synchronized hip thrusts for momentum, deep knee flexion in jumps, and precise ankle adjustments for agile landings and redirections.
