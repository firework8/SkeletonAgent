Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'motorcycling' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The rider mounts the motorcycle, grips the handlebars, leans forward, and shifts weight to balance while accelerating by twisting the throttle and steering by tilting the body and handlebars.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'motorcycling': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns to check mirrors or leans slightly with body for balance.  
Hand: Grips handlebars firmly, operates throttle and brakes with fingers.  
Arm: Slightly bent to absorb shocks, steers by pushing or pulling handlebars.  
Hip: Shifts weight to lean into turns or stabilize during acceleration.  
Leg: Presses against tank for grip, extends to support when stopping.  
Foot: Operates gearshift and rear brake, rests on pegs while riding.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'motorcycling' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes upper body, aids in steering by adjusting arm position.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, helps control handlebar grip and posture.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to absorb road vibrations, assists in steering movements.  
9-right elbow: Similar to left elbow, maintains slight bend for throttle control.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight for balance during leans and turns.  
13-right hip: Works with left hip to stabilize lower body while cornering.  
16-left ankle: Operates gearshift lever, adjusts foot position on peg.  
17-right ankle: Controls rear brake pedal, maintains foot placement for stability.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'motorcycling' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Motorcycling is recognized by the rider's bent elbows absorbing shocks while shoulders and hips shift weight to steer, with ankles precisely operating foot controls and knees gripping the tank for stability during leans.
