Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'snowboarding' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends slightly at the knees and hips, leaning forward or backward to shift weight, while the feet remain strapped to the board, guiding it downhill with controlled turns and balance adjustments.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'snowboarding': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns to look ahead or sideways for balance and direction.  
Hand: Extends slightly for balance or tucks in for aerodynamics.  
Arm: Moves subtly to counterbalance turns or maintain stability.  
Hip: Shifts weight forward or backward to steer the board.  
Leg: Flexes or extends to absorb terrain and control speed.  
Foot: Adjusts pressure on toes or heels to initiate turns.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'snowboarding' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly to aid balance and turning.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder for coordinated upper-body movement.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight forward or back to steer the board.  
13-right hip: Works with left hip for smooth weight transitions.  
14-left knee: Flexes to absorb bumps and control stance.  
15-right knee: Adjusts bend to match terrain and maintain stability.  
16-left ankle: Tilts to apply toe or heel pressure for turns.  
17-right ankle: Coordinates with left ankle for precise edge control.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'snowboarding' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Snowboarding is recognized by coordinated hip shifts steering the board while knees flex dynamically over terrain, ankles tilt for edge control, and shoulders rotate subtly to maintain balance during turns.
