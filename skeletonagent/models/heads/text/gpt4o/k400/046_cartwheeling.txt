Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'cartwheeling' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs a cartwheel by starting in a standing position, then placing hands on the ground while kicking the legs overhead in a sideways rotation, landing one foot at a time back on the ground.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'cartwheeling': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts sideways and follows the rotation while facing downward during the movement.  
Hand: Plants firmly on the ground, bearing weight as the body rotates.  
Arm: Extends fully to support the body's weight during the rotation.  
Hip: Rotates upward and sideways, driving the legs over the body.  
Leg: Kicks forcefully overhead, one after the other, to propel the rotation.  
Foot: Lands sequentially, one after the other, completing the motion.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'cartwheeling' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates downward as the arm plants, then upward during the flip.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, driving the sideways rotation.  
10-left wrist: Bears weight during hand plant, then extends to push off.  
11-right wrist: Supports body weight, then releases as rotation completes.  
12-left hip: Lifts and rotates to propel the legs overhead.  
13-right hip: Follows left hip, maintaining momentum in the flip.  
16-left ankle: Flexes during kick, then stabilizes landing.  
17-right ankle: Extends during kick, then absorbs impact on landing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'cartwheeling' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
A cartwheel is recognized by the alternating shoulder rotation driving sideways momentum, wrists bearing then pushing off weight, hips lifting legs overhead in a circular arc, and ankles flexing during the kick before stabilizing the staggered landing.
