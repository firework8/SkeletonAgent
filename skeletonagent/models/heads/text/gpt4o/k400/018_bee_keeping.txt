Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'bee keeping' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body moves the arms gently side to side while slightly crouching, mimicking the swaying motion of a bee keeper tending to hives.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'bee keeping': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slowly to observe hive activity.  
Hand: Grips smoker or hive tool with controlled movements.  
Arm: Extends gently to manipulate frames or puff smoke.  
Hip: Shifts weight slightly when bending near the hive.  
Leg: Steps carefully to maintain balance on uneven ground.  
Foot: Presses firmly to avoid disturbing the hive base.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'bee keeping' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Slightly lifts and rotates when handling hive tools.  
7-right shoulder: Moves forward when puffing smoke gently.  
8-left elbow: Bends to adjust frame angle carefully.  
9-right elbow: Extends smoothly to direct smoke.  
10-left wrist: Tilts to manipulate frames with precision.  
11-right wrist: Flicks lightly to control smoker airflow.  
18-mid hip: Shifts weight subtly for balance near hive.  
19-thorax: Leans forward slightly to inspect hive closely.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'bee keeping' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The bee keeping action is recognized by the shoulders and elbows guiding controlled, deliberate arm movements while the wrists make fine adjustments, paired with a slight forward lean of the thorax and subtle weight shifts at the hips for balance near the hive.
