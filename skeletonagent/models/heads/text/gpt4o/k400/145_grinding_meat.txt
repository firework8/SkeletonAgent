Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'grinding meat' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'grinding meat' action by gripping the meat with one hand, using the other to push a knife or grinder in a repetitive back-and-forth or circular motion, applying downward pressure to break the meat into smaller pieces.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'grinding meat': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Slightly tilted forward, eyes focused on the meat and tool.  
Hand: Grips the knife or grinder handle firmly, applying downward and pushing force.  
Arm: Moves in controlled back-and-forth or circular motions to shred the meat.  
Hip: Remains stable, occasionally shifting weight for balance.  
Leg: Slightly bent, providing a steady base.  
Foot: Flat on the ground, maintaining stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'grinding meat' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing arm rotation for grinding motion.  
7-right shoulder: Anchors the arm, enabling controlled downward force.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to adjust grinding pressure and tool movement.  
9-right elbow: Extends and bends to drive the knife or grinder.  
10-left wrist: Maintains a firm grip while guiding the tool.  
11-right wrist: Adjusts angle for efficient meat shredding.  
18-mid hip: Shifts slightly for balance during repetitive motion.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates upper body stability during the task.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'grinding meat' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The 'grinding meat' action is recognized by stable shoulders anchoring alternating elbow flexion-extension driving the wrists in short, forceful back-and-forth motions while the mid-hip subtly shifts weight to maintain balance against resistance.
