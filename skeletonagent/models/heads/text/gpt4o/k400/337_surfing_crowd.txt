Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'surfing crowd' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The 'surfing crowd' action involves the body being lifted and passed overhead by a group, with the person lying flat, arms extended for balance, while the crowd shifts them forward using their hands.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'surfing crowd': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Stays stable, facing upward or slightly tilted back.  
Hand: Fingers spread slightly for balance, palms may press lightly on supporters.  
Arm: Extended straight or slightly bent, aiding stability overhead.  
Hip: Remains flat and aligned with the torso to distribute weight evenly.  
Leg: Kept straight and together, minimizing movement to stay balanced.  
Foot: Toes pointed or relaxed, feet held close to avoid kicking bystanders.

Based on the movement process of the 'surfing crowd' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifted upward, stabilizing torso as arms extend.

10-left wrist: Held firm, fingers spread to distribute hand pressure evenly.  
11-right wrist: Matches left wrist, ensuring steady contact with supporters.

2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle
