Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'planting trees' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The person bends at the waist and knees, digs a hole with a shovel, places a sapling inside, covers the roots with soil, and pats the ground firmly.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'planting trees': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Looks down to focus on the planting spot.  
Hand: Grips shovel or holds sapling steady.  
Arm: Moves shovel to dig or supports planting motion.  
Hip: Bends forward to lower body toward the ground.  
Leg: Flexes at the knee to crouch or stabilize.  
Foot: Presses into soil for balance or steps on shovel.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'planting trees' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates and lowers to position shovel or sapling.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes or assists in digging motion.  
8-left elbow: Bends to control shovel depth or adjust grip.  
9-right elbow: Flexes to apply force when digging or planting.  
12-left hip: Shifts weight forward during bending and digging.  
13-right hip: Supports balance while crouching or stepping.  
14-left knee: Flexes deeply to lower body for planting.  
15-right knee: Adjusts angle to maintain stability.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'planting trees' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by coordinated bending of the knees and hips to lower the torso, paired with asymmetric arm movements—one driving a shovel or stabilizing a sapling while the other supports—culminating in a controlled forward lean and weight shift during soil manipulation.
