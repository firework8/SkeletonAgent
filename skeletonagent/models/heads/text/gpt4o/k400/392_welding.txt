Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'welding' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs welding by gripping the torch, positioning it at the joint, moving it steadily along the seam while maintaining a consistent angle and distance, and occasionally pausing to adjust or reposition for precision.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'welding': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly to observe the weld pool and joint alignment.  
Hand: Grips the torch or electrode holder with controlled pressure.  
Arm: Moves steadily along the weld path with precise coordination.  
Hip: Adjusts stance to maintain balance and reach the work area.  
Leg: Shifts weight to stabilize posture during prolonged welding.  
Foot: Repositions to support body movement and maintain stability.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'welding' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes and rotates to guide arm movement along weld path.  
7-right shoulder: Adjusts height and angle to position the torch precisely.  
8-left elbow: Flexes to maintain optimal distance between torch and workpiece.  
9-right elbow: Controls torch movement speed and steadiness during welding.  
10-left wrist: Fine-tunes grip and minor adjustments for electrode or filler rod.  
11-right wrist: Directs torch angle and arc stability with subtle rotations.  
18-mid hip: Anchors posture, shifting weight for balance during welding.  
20-mid shoulder: Coordinates bilateral arm movements for smooth weld progression.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'welding' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Welding is recognized by the shoulders and elbows guiding precise torch movement while the wrists fine-tune angle and stability, all anchored by coordinated hip and torso adjustments to maintain steady posture during the weld path.
