Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'tango dancing' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The dancers move in close embrace, stepping smoothly with precise footwork, shifting weight between legs while maintaining strong posture and fluid hip movements, often pausing dramatically or executing sharp turns and syncopated steps in sync with the music.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'tango dancing': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly or turns sharply, maintaining intense eye contact or dramatic gaze.  
Hand: Holds partner's hand firmly or shapes elegantly in solo movements, fingers often extended.  
Arm: Moves with controlled tension, framing the embrace or leading/following with precise arcs.  
Hip: Swivels smoothly in ochos or remains stable during walks, adding subtle sway to steps.  
Leg: Extends long in kicks or crosses tightly in pivots, muscles engaged for balance.  
Foot: Glides precisely on the floor, brushing or striking sharply in sync with the rhythm.

================================================================================

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'tango dancing' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Moves dynamically for leading/following, stabilizing the embrace.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder, maintaining frame and posture.  
12-left hip: Swivels sharply in ochos or maintains controlled rotation.  
13-right hip: Syncs with left hip, adding fluidity to steps and pivots.  
16-left ankle: Flexes for smooth glides or sharp strikes in footwork.  
17-right ankle: Balances weight shifts, aiding quick directional changes.  
18-mid hip: Anchors body movement, driving rotations and weight transfers.  
20-mid shoulder: Aligns torso, ensuring upper-body stability during turns.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'tango dancing' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Tango dancing is recognized by sharp hip rotations and precise ankle flexions driving dramatic weight shifts, while shoulders maintain a rigid yet dynamic frame and mid-hip anchors controlled pivots, all moving in tight synchronization with rhythmic footwork.
