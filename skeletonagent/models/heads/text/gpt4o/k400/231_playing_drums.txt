Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'playing drums' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The arms alternate striking drum surfaces with sticks while the hands grip and control the motion, wrists flex for precision, shoulders stabilize, and the torso may sway slightly to maintain rhythm, with feet occasionally pressing pedals for bass or hi-hat control.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'playing drums': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: May nod or tilt slightly to maintain rhythm.  
Hand: Grips sticks tightly while wrists flick for strikes.  
Arm: Moves up and down to power stick hits.  
Hip: Shifts weight subtly for balance and groove.  
Leg: Stays planted or lifts slightly for pedal control.  
Foot: Presses pedals for bass drum or hi-hat hits.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'playing drums' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Stabilizes while allowing arm rotation for drum strikes.  
7-right shoulder: Moves dynamically to power stick swings.  
8-left elbow: Flexes and extends to control stick height.  
9-right elbow: Acts as pivot for rapid wrist strikes.  
10-left wrist: Flicks precisely for snare or tom hits.  
11-right wrist: Drives main rhythm with controlled rebounds.  
16-left ankle: Adjusts heel-toe for bass drum pedal control.  
17-right ankle: Taps hi-hat pedal for consistent timing.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'playing drums' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The action is recognized by dynamic shoulder rotations powering rapid elbow-hinged wrist strikes, synchronized with subtle ankle flexions for pedal control, while the upper body maintains a stable yet rhythmic posture.
