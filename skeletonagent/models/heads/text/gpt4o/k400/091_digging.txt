Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'digging' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body bends at the waist and knees, grips a shovel with both hands, drives it into the ground using arm and torso force, lifts and tosses the soil aside by pivoting the torso and extending the arms.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'digging': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Tilts slightly forward to focus on the digging spot.  
Hand: Grips the shovel handle tightly, adjusting for leverage.  
Arm: Extends and retracts to drive and lift the shovel.  
Hip: Hinges forward and back to generate force.  
Leg: Bends and straightens to support lifting and pushing.  
Foot: Presses into the ground or steps on the shovel for stability.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'digging' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates forward and back to drive shovel motion.  
7-right shoulder: Stabilizes while left arm powers the digging.  
8-left elbow: Bends to lift shovel, extends to thrust downward.  
9-right elbow: Maintains slight bend for control and balance.  
12-left hip: Hinges forward to add force to shovel strikes.  
13-right hip: Anchors stance, supporting weight shifts.  
14-left knee: Flexes to lower body, extends to push upward.  
15-right knee: Steadies posture during digging rhythm.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'digging' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
Digging is recognized by the coordinated forward hinge of the hips, alternating shoulder-driven arm extensions with elbow bends to lift and thrust the shovel, while knees flex and extend to power the motion and stabilize posture.
