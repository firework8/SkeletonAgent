Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'dancing macarena' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body performs the 'dancing macarena' by first extending both arms straight forward, then placing the right hand over the left shoulder and the left hand over the right shoulder, followed by moving both hands to the back of the head, then to the hips, and finally shaking the hips while swinging the arms side to side.

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'dancing macarena': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Stays mostly upright with slight tilting during hip shakes.  
Hand: Palms face down, then cross to opposite shoulders, then head, then hips.  
Arm: Extends forward, bends at elbows during shoulder touches, then swings side to side.  
Hip: Sways side to side during the final shake step.  
Leg: Steps lightly in place with slight bending during hip movements.  
Foot: Lifts slightly on steps, mostly stays grounded with small shifts.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'dancing macarena' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Lifts slightly as arms extend forward, then relaxes during cross-shoulder touches.  
7-right shoulder: Mirrors left shoulder movement, lifting and relaxing in sync.  
8-left elbow: Bends sharply when hand touches right shoulder, then straightens.  
9-right elbow: Bends sharply when hand touches left shoulder, then straightens.  
10-left wrist: Rotates palm down during extension, then moves in sync with elbow.  
11-right wrist: Rotates palm down during extension, then moves in sync with elbow.  
12-left hip: Sways outward during the final shake, driving leg movement.  
13-right hip: Sways outward opposite left hip, creating rhythmic motion.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'dancing macarena' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The 'dancing macarena' is recognized by symmetrical arm extensions followed by crossed shoulder touches, sharp elbow bends during hand placements, and rhythmic hip sways driving the final shake.
