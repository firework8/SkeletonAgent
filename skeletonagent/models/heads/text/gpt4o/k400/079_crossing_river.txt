Round 1 Question:
Describe the movement process of the human body performing the 'crossing river' action in a sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No line breaks
2. Keep descriptions brief
3. Start directly with the description

Round 1 Answer:
The human body shifts weight onto one foot, lifts the other leg to step forward while maintaining balance, then alternates legs in a smooth, rhythmic motion to cross the river.

================================================================================

Round 2 Question:
Describe the following body parts actions in short when 'crossing river': head, hand, arm, hip, leg, foot.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Each body part must be listed separately in this exact order: Head, Hand, Arm, Hip, Leg, Foot
2. Format as "[Body part]: [Description]." with no dashes or numbers
3. Use exactly one line per body part with no blank lines
4. Never combine body parts (e.g., no "Hand & Arm")
5. Descriptions must be brief, specific, and focused on motion

Round 2 Answer:
Head: Turns slightly to observe footing and maintain balance.  
Hand: Extends outward or lightly touches surroundings for stability.  
Arm: Swings naturally or reaches for support if needed.  
Hip: Shifts side-to-side to adjust weight during each step.  
Leg: Lifts and steps forward, clearing obstacles like rocks or water.  
Foot: Presses firmly on stable surfaces, testing footing before shifting weight.

Round 3 Question:
The human body can be further represented as 20 skeleton joints:
1-nose, 2-left eye, 3-right eye, 4-left ear, 5-right ear, 6-left shoulder, 7-right shoulder, 8-left elbow, 9-right elbow, 10-left wrist, 11-right wrist, 12-left hip, 13-right hip, 14-left knee, 15-right knee, 16-left ankle, 17-right ankle, 18-mid hip, 19-thorax, 20-mid shoulder.
Based on the movement process of the 'crossing river' action, please point out all joints that are critical for distinguishing this action from similar ones.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. List only the numerical labels of critical joints
2. Separate labels with commas and single spaces
3. Order the numbers from smallest to largest
4. Put all numbers on one line with no line breaks
5. Do not include any other text or explanations

Round 3 Answer:
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

================================================================================

Round 4 Question:
For all the critical joints listed above, describe their movement details in short.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. Use exact format: "[label]-[joint name]: [description]."
2. One joint per line, no blank lines
3. List joints in increasing numerical order
4. Exclude non-critical joints
5. If >10 critical joints, select 4-8 most important
6. Keep it brief but informative

Round 4 Answer:
6-left shoulder: Rotates slightly forward with arm swing during stepping.  
7-right shoulder: Counterbalances left shoulder, moving backward when opposite leg steps.  
12-left hip: Shifts laterally to support weight during right leg lift.  
13-right hip: Pushes forward to propel body during left leg step.  
14-left knee: Flexes to lift foot and clear obstacles.  
15-right knee: Stabilizes weight transfer during left leg movement.  
16-left ankle: Adjusts angle for secure footing on uneven surfaces.  
17-right ankle: Provides push-off force when stepping forward.

================================================================================

Round 5 Question:
Based on the above information, please summarize how the 'crossing river' action can be recognized by key joint movements in one concise sentence.
Strictly follow these rules:
1. No lists, line breaks, or joint numbers
2. Focus on the overall motion signature
3. Start directly with the description without introduction phrases
4. Must clearly reflect what makes this action unique or subtle

Round 5 Answer:
The 'crossing river' action is recognized by coordinated hip shifts for balance, alternating knee lifts to clear obstacles, precise ankle adjustments for unstable footing, and counterbalancing shoulder rotations during each step.
